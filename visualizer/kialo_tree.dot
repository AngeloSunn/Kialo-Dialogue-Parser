visiting museums [2] around the world
has been falling (p. 4 [3]).";

than ever before. With plummeting
viewership, these channels may no longer
exist in the future.";
    "1.1.1.4.2 [st-22]

US with a TV. Having a means of
consuming art in their home makes it far
more accessible in general.";

expensive [33] to run than electricity
from the power grid.";

Electricity rates in some developing
countries are capped, meaning they have
less of an impact on the operational
costs of owning a TV (p. 4 [34]).";

Many people in the global south and
developing nations worldwide have access

Popular networks, such as the BBC, rely
heavily [142] on the use of stereotypes
