Discussion Name:
Is television bad for people?

1. Thesis:
Television is bad for people.

  1.1. Con:
  TV is a vital outlet for the arts and creative human expression.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    TV might be the only exposure [1] to the arts for many people, assuming they do not read books or visit museums.

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      People should be incentivized to visit museums and read books, not find justification for their habit of watching poor quality TV programming.

      1.1.1.2. Pro:
      The number of people reading books and visiting museums [2] around the world has been falling (p. 4 [3]).

      1.1.1.3. Pro:
      TV allows people to watch films they may have missed or would be unable to afford to see at the cinema.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        For people of a lower economic status, watching television is the only way they can enjoy the same movies as those who can afford to see them at the movie theater. Thus, TV is a social good.

          1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
          The price of cinema tickets vary from country to country [4], and can be incredibly affordable [5] in some places.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
            Some movie theater chains give discounts for kids [6] and young people, senior citizens [7], members of the military [8], and essential workers [9].

            1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
            In countries like Mali, a single cinema ticket can cost 59% of the average weekly wage [10].

            1.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
            Theater promotions and cinema subscription services [11] can drive down the price of cinema tickets, making them even more affordable.

        1.1.1.3.2. Con:
        Most films are only released to be shown on TV or streaming long after [12] they are released in cinema.

          1.1.1.3.2.1. Con:
          Not everyone has the time to watch movies as soon as they hit theaters. Some might prefer the flexibility of watching the movie at a later date.

          1.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
          New blockbuster movies are increasingly seeing early or simultaneous streaming releases [13].

        1.1.1.3.3. Pro:
        The diverse offering of shows available on TV and streaming services [14] allows people to access a variety of content they wouldn't have access to otherwise.

          1.1.1.3.3.1. Con:
          Streaming services tend to have dynamic and restrictive catalogues. Netflix has around [15] 6,000 shows and movies, while IMDB is approaching five million [16] entries, meaning that only 0.12% of movies IMDB has indexed are available on Netflix.

      1.1.1.4. Con:
      Impoverished people who struggle to afford [17] cable television are left with just the local channels and few options for entertainment.

        1.1.1.4.1. Pro:
        Local channels are often biased and choose to present certain pieces of news while ignoring others.

          1.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
          Most people in the US trust local news more than national sources, and believe they are less ideologically biased [18].

          1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro:
          Local news channels are more likely to encounter funding issues [19] than large national news outlets, and are thus more susceptible to bribery or economic biases.

          1.1.1.4.1.3. Con:
          People are watching less live TV [20] than ever before. With plummeting viewership, these channels may no longer exist in the future.

        1.1.1.4.2. Con:
        TV piracy [21] is accessible, on the rise and unlikely to lead to any severe consequences. If someone cannot afford TV, then they can easily pirate it.

          1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
          Many channels, especially those showing live sports, are illegally mirrored online [22] and available for free.

          1.1.1.4.2.2. Con:
          Pirate networks are frequently targeted and shut down [23] by international government investigations.

          1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro:
          In poorer regions, one cable subscriber can share their access [24] with entire neighborhoods.

          1.1.1.4.2.4. Con:
          Suggesting theft of intellectual property is hardly a reasonable substitute for paying for cable.

        1.1.1.4.3. Con:
        People are only able to physically watch one TV channel at a time. While people without cable have fewer options, they are still able to access some form of programming.

          1.1.1.4.3.1. Con:
          The variety and diversity of channels available is the issue, not how many can be watched at once.

          1.1.1.4.3.2. Pro:
          Many countries have national broadcasters, like the BBC [25], which can be accessed without an expensive cable subscription.

          1.1.1.4.3.3. Con:
          Picture-in-Picture [26] allows people to watch multiple channels at once.

            1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Con:
            PiP, despite once being a popular feature, has been made obsolete [27] by newer technology.

      1.1.1.5. Pro:
      There are 122 million homes [28] in the US with a TV. Having a means of consuming art in their home makes it far more accessible in general.

      1.1.1.6. Con:
      TV requires that a household have consistent and cheap power, as TVs consume a lot of electricity [29].

        1.1.1.6.1. Pro:
        Many developing countries have load-shedding [30] or power outages [31], which might interrupt people's viewing to the point where the TV would be useless.

        1.1.1.6.2. Con:
        TVs can be run using external generators [32], which are not reliant on national power grids.

          1.1.1.6.2.1. Con:
          Most people cannot afford external generators—they are generally more expensive [33] to run than electricity from the power grid.

        1.1.1.6.3. Con:
        Electricity rates in some developing countries are capped, meaning they have less of an impact on the operational costs of owning a TV (p. 4 [34]).

      1.1.1.7. Pro:
      Many people in the global south and developing nations worldwide have access to TV sets [35].

        1.1.1.7.1. Con:
        Cable can be costly, especially in developing countries like the Philippines. Cable plans can cost US$35 [36] per month, yet the minimum wage is as low as US$7.50 per day [37].

    1.1.2. Pro:
    TV series can explore deep and significant philosophical and artistic themes.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      The content of many TV shows is mindless [38], which is harmful to the viewer.

        1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
        Most TV shows are mindless and serve as an escape [39] from the problems and issues most people face on a daily basis.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        Philosophical and artistic merit can be gleaned from nearly anything [40] one does in life.

        1.1.2.1.3. Con:
        Viewers may want to relax by watching simple, entertaining programs which they do not need to intellectually engage with [41].

          1.1.2.1.3.1. Con:
          Using one's brain is a natural and beneficial part of life; it can deteriorate [42] if not used regularly.

        1.1.2.1.4. Pro:
        Characters in popular sitcoms [43] have been known to become stupider as the series progresses and the script quality deteriorates.

        1.1.2.1.5. Pro:
        The majority of world's most popular TV shows [44] do not explore significant philosophical or artistic themes.

        1.1.2.1.6. Pro:
        A number of TV channels [45] have intentionally dumbed down their content.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      The critically-acclaimed TV anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, explores themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility [46]. Such heavy and complex themes are common in other art forms.

      1.1.2.3. Pro:
      Black Mirror uses TV as a medium to critique technology and modern society [47]. This is a common theme in more traditional forms of art [48].

      1.1.2.4. Con:
      Nearly one-third of UK adults [49] believe that TV programming gets worse every year.

        1.1.2.4.1. Con:
        Public perception does not equate to fact; people could become biased by others' opinions.

        1.1.2.4.2. Con:
        People might be exposed to poorer quality shows more often without the overall quality of shows decreasing.

    1.1.3. Con:
    TV is only an outlet for the creative expression of a small number of writers, directors, and producers. TV viewers are merely consumers.

      1.1.3.1. Con:
      Public-access TV [50] allows the average citizen to create and air their own creative works.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      The Writers' Guild of America (WGA) only has 20,000 members [51] and fewer than 5,000 [52] of them earned money from their screenplays in 2016.

    1.1.4. Con:
    Theater, school plays, and other live arts are also outlets [53] for creative expression.

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      Theater is more accessible than TV in terms of both participation and consumption.

        1.1.4.1.1. Pro:
        Public theater, such as Shakespeare in the park [54], is often viewable free of charge.

      1.1.4.2. Con:
      Live arts are restrictive and unavailable most of the time. TV programming is always available, day and night.

        1.1.4.2.1. Con:
        Many adult entertainment centers are open most hours when many other plays and live arts performances are over.

  1.2. Pro:
  TV has a negative impact on health.

    1.2.1. Con:
    Watching TV from the safety of one's home keeps people out of trouble and protects them from a variety of public dangers.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      People can also involve themselves in potentially dangerous activities while watching TV, such as smoking marijuana [55].

      1.2.1.2. Con:
      Social isolation can cause loneliness, cognitive decline, and depression [56].

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      People who stayed at home watching TV during the pandemic kept themselves safe [57] and improved their relationships with their families.

        1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
        Nearly four-in-five households [58] increased their TV consumption, which literally helped save lives [59].

        1.2.1.3.2. Con:
        There was a marked rise in domestic violence [60] during the pandemic, indicating that many people, especially women, were not kept safe.

        1.2.1.3.3. Con:
        People staying home could have been, and likely were, doing other activities [61] than watching TV.

    1.2.2. Con:
    People can come together and form positive communities around their favorite television shows, improving mental health [62].

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      The fan community around Star Trek has been described as good-willed and dizzyingly diverse [63], creating an undeniably positive environment.

        1.2.2.1.1. Con:
        Even positive fan communities like Star Trek have an issue with extreme toxicity [64].

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      Some TV show communities can be toxic, engaging in bullying and other antisocial behavior [65].

        1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
        Star Wars fan culture has been described as toxic [66], sexist, and closed-minded.

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        A man was beaten up in Hong Kong for spoiling the end [67] of Avengers: Endgame.

      1.2.2.3. Pro:
      The Doctor Who TV series has cultivated a large and loyal fanbase [68], which has lead to the development of multiple fan projects [69] and zines.

      1.2.2.4. Pro:
      Shows like Game of Thrones [70] encouraged fan discussion and theory through their episodic nature, resulting in millions of fans flooding online communities with speculation about what would happen in the next episode.

        1.2.2.4.1. Pro:
        Even after the finale of the TV show, fan communities for the show and book series remain active [71] in multiple languages.

        1.2.2.4.2. Con:
        The obsession over Game of Thrones likely led to a decrease in productivity and social interaction as fans spent too much time [72] pouring over articles and expounding upon theories.

      1.2.2.5. Con:
      If people were to spend less time [73] watching TV, they would have more free time to pursue more constructive hobbies, or to play sports.

        1.2.2.5.1. Con:
        People could opt to instead engage with similarly unhealthy practices, such as playing video games or scrolling through social media on their phone.

    1.2.3. Pro:
    TV causes physical health problems.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      Increased television viewing has a minor association [74] with shorter sleep duration.

        1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
        A lack of sleep can increase the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart issues [75], demonstrating that increased TV viewing is bad for one's health.

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      TV can encourage sedentary behavior [76], which can lead to health issues [77].

        1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
        Watching excessive amounts of TV can lower sperm count [78].

          1.2.3.2.1.1. Con:
          For men that do not desire [79] to have children, a lower sperm count is not a relevant concern.

        1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
        Prolonged TV watching is associated [80] with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality, independent of leisure-time physical activity, among colorectal cancer patients.

          1.2.3.2.2.1. Con:
          There are a number of other activities and behaviors [81] which are equally or more likely to cause colorectal cancers.

        1.2.3.2.3. Pro:
        People who watch more than two hours a day of TV have an increased risk of many diseases and reduced lifespan [82].

          1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro:
          Excessive hours of sitting to watch TV has been linked to an increased risk of dying from inflammatory diseases like Alzheimer’s and diabetes, according to an Australian study [83].

        1.2.3.2.4. Con:
        Reading is a sedentary activity, yet not labeled as a negative activity. As such, TV should be considered an adjacent category.

          1.2.3.2.4.1. Con:
          Reading books has proven to have positive effects [84] on the development of children [85], brain function, and overall health, whereas watching TV has notable negative lifestyle effects [86].

          1.2.3.2.4.2. Pro:
          Reading has a number of associated physical and mental harms [87], similarly to watching TV.

        1.2.3.2.5. Pro:
        Sitting down for significant periods of time to watch television may increase the risk of dying from a pulmonary embolism [88].

        1.2.3.2.6. Con:
        TV viewers do not need to be seated while watching TV. They can perform exercises [89] or use exercise equipment, like a treadmill [90].

          1.2.3.2.6.1. Con:
          Very few people exercise while watching TV; Americans in particular spend significantly more time watching TV than exercising [91] in general.

        1.2.3.2.7. Pro:
        Couches and recliners, common seats used for watching television, are designed for unhealthy sedentary behaviors [92].

      1.2.3.3. Con:
      Watching excessive amounts of TV is likely correlated with health problems; in moderation, it presents no such harms.

        1.2.3.3.1. Con:
        Health risks can occur after two hours [93] of watching TV. The average American watches more than five hours a day [94].

        1.2.3.3.2. Pro:
        In order for TV use to be deemed excessive [95], one must watch more than 3.5 hours of TV per day. It is likely that many people watch less than this.

      1.2.3.4. Pro:
      Most TV programs are designed to encourage unhealthy watching habits.

        1.2.3.4.1. Pro:
        TV streaming services encourage binge-watching by automatically playing [96] the next episode [97] of a series.

        1.2.3.4.2. Pro:
        Twenty-four-hour news channels compete for viewership by sensationalizing [98] news stories, which can end up causing anxiety and stress among viewers.

      1.2.3.5. Con:
      Compared to other addictions, like cigarettes or alcohol, watching television is not as harmful.

        1.2.3.5.1. Con:
        Television sets are built with harmful chemicals [99], the exposure to which could cause severe health problems.

        1.2.3.5.2. Pro:
        Smoking directly causes a number of ailments such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and bronchitis [100], as well as increasing the risk of a number of diseases.

        1.2.3.5.3. Pro:
        Abusing alcohol damages many internal organs, as well as increasing risk factors for heart attacks and stroke [101].

        1.2.3.5.4. Con:
        Prolonged TV watching increases the risk of diabetes and especially heart disease [102], which is more deadly [103] than all forms of cancer combined.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    TV viewership is harmful to the physical and mental health of children.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      The physical health of children deteriorates when they watch excessive amounts of TV.

        1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
        Kids who watch a lot of television may build less bone [104] during critical years and be more vulnerable to osteoporosis and bone breaks later in life as a result.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        A recent study [105] linked kids' TV habits with higher cholesterol and worse health outcomes, suggesting that two or more hours of daily viewing may produce heart problems later in life.

        1.2.4.1.3. Pro:
        Parents are recommended [106] to limit their children to one to two hours of high-quality programming each day to protect them from negative influences or outcomes.

          1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro:
          Children who spend many hours a day glued to the TV may be harming their ability to concentrate [107] and focus on tasks in school.

          1.2.4.1.3.2. Pro:
          Excessive hours spent watching television in a child's youth may be related [108] to an increased risk of antisocial [109] behaviour later in life.

        1.2.4.1.4. Con:
        Diet and exercise [110] are the most important factors in raising healthy children; TV is not detrimental if children are active and eat well.

          1.2.4.1.4.1. Con:
          A study [111] found that the more hours spent watching television, the more likely children were to be both fatter and less physically active. Notedly, kindergartners who watched more than three hours of TV per day were nearly 50% more likely [112] to be obese.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      TV lowers [113] the self-esteem of most children.

        1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
        TV decreases the self-esteem [114] of white girls, Black girls, and Black boys.

      1.2.4.3. Con:
      TV programs can foster and encourage good behaviour in children.

        1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
        TV can encourage [115] reading in children.

          1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          Shows like 'Reading Rainbow' [116] introduced children to books and stories they may otherwise miss.

            1.2.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Introducing children to the concept of reading books does not necessarily incentivize them to read on their own.

          1.2.4.3.1.2. Con:
          The British Council developed a list of eight common methods of encouraging children to read [117]; watching TV to incentivize the practice of reading was not mentioned.

        1.2.4.3.2. Pro:
        Preschool children displayed less aggression and more empathy [118] towards others when their exposure to aggressive television shows were limited, and their exposure to educational programming was increased.

        1.2.4.3.3. Pro:
        When TV characters demonstrate social-emotional skills, children can learn from them. Television shows that depict sharing, getting along with others, or rejecting stereotypes can improve those skills in children [119].

        1.2.4.3.4. Con:
        The negative effects [120] of TV on children far outweigh the positive effects.

      1.2.4.4. Con:
      Many activities are age-restricted [121] to protect the health of children; television is no different.

        1.2.4.4.1. Pro:
        The TV rating system exists to prevent children from consuming inappropriate content on TV (p. 2 [122]).

          1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro:
          Broadcasters in some countries abide by a watershed [123], banning the airing of content deemed child-inappropriate before a certain time at night.

          1.2.4.4.1.2. Con:
          TV ratings systems have fundamental flaws [124] that prevent parents from making informed decisions on what their children watch.

            1.2.4.4.1.2.1. Pro:
            G-rated prime-time TV is nearly non-existent [125], and the lines between TV-PG and TV-14 categories are blurred [126].

            1.2.4.4.1.2.2. Pro:
            Shows rated TV-14 have as many depictions of smoking and drinking [127] as TV-MA programming, making it difficult for parents to prevent their children being exposed to this content.

            1.2.4.4.1.2.3. Con:
            TV ratings systems are merely guidelines, and cannot be expected to replace the individual judgement of parents.

        1.2.4.4.2. Pro:
        It is the responsibility of parents to manage a child's TV usage and behaviour in order to limit any negative physical and mental effects.

    1.2.5. Pro:
    TV has harmful psychological effects.

      1.2.5.1. Con:
      Watching excessive [128] amounts of TV is primarily a form of escapism [129] from the pressures and stresses of daily life, suggesting that TV can actually be psychologically beneficial.

        1.2.5.1.1. Pro:
        Watching television relieves loneliness by providing the same sort of emotional support [130] as spending time with real people.

        1.2.5.1.2. Con:
        Researchers [131] say that the social surrogacy provided by TV programs is a poor substitution for human-to-human experience.

      1.2.5.2. Pro:
      TV promotes drug use and abuse.

        1.2.5.2.1. Pro:
        Movies & shows glorifying substance abuse lifestyle like Narcos [132], Breaking Bad [133] and The Wolf of Wall Street [134] are widely known, while there is little attention for the actual damages of the opioid crisis and the drug trade.

        1.2.5.2.2. Con:
        TV has often been used to broadcast [135] the dangers of drug abuse, portraying [136] drug use in a negative light.

        1.2.5.2.3. Pro:
        The causes of adolescent substance use are multifactorial, but the media can play a key role [137].

          1.2.5.2.3.1. Pro:
          Portrayals of alcohol [138] in films and TV advertisements have an immediate effect on the amount of alcohol that people drink.

      1.2.5.3. Pro:
      Television can create division with shows [139] that perpetuate false stereotypes.

        1.2.5.3.1. Pro:
        Many TV shows perpetuate [140] the "angry African American" stereotype.

        1.2.5.3.2. Pro:
        Some shows can reinforce [141] the idea that masculine traits are more acceptable than feminine traits.

        1.2.5.3.3. Con:
        Any form of media or communication can be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The issue lies with the society that tolerates such stereotypes, not the media which they are portrayed in.

        1.2.5.3.4. Pro:
        Popular networks, such as the BBC, rely heavily [142] on the use of stereotypes when portraying gay people, and often make them the subject of derisive jokes (p. 8 [143], p. 11 [144]).

        1.2.5.3.5. Con:
        Television shows can bring people together and break down barriers by striking down stereotypes through authentic portrayals of genuine people.

          1.2.5.3.5.1. Con:
          With the number of spinoffs and rebooted shows [145] on TV nowadays, they are more likely to cling onto false narratives that increase their ratings.

          1.2.5.3.5.2. Pro:
          When immigrants, especially undocumented workers, were realistically portrayed on TV, anti-immigrant sentiments fell [146].

          1.2.5.3.5.3. Pro:
          In a watershed moment on one of the most famous episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Mr. Rodgers invited a Black police officer to share the same pool, even washing Officer Clemmons' feet, forever changing [147] the way Black men were portrayed on TV at that time.

      1.2.5.4. Pro:
      TV has been known to be addictive [148].

        1.2.5.4.1. Con:
        Nearly anything can be addictive [149]; the problem is people's ability to control their own consumption, not a problem with the object of their consumption.

        1.2.5.4.2. Pro:
        TV provides an emotional escape [150] from negative feelings. As a result, people become addicted to the relief of these emotions while watching TV.

        1.2.5.4.3. Pro:
        Binge-watching is an impulsive [151] behavior; the brain reacts in a similar manner to other addictions [152], such as drugs and alcohol.

          1.2.5.4.3.1. Con:
          Binge-watching provides viewers [153] with a sense of community by bonding with others over a shared interest in the same TV shows.

          1.2.5.4.3.2. Pro:
          Addiction born out of escapism can lead to a decline in self compassion [154], which is harmful to the addict's life.

        1.2.5.4.4. Pro:
        Netflix, credited for inventing binge-watching [155], pushes shows onto people without self-control without their explicit consent by automatically playing the next episode of a TV show.

      1.2.5.5. Con:
      Only if people take it seriously enough to conflate its inherently-mediated (ie, vicarious) [156] experiences with their own unmediated (ie, direct) personal ones.

    1.2.6. Con:
    Watching sporting events or art shows might encourage people to pursue these activities, ultimately bettering their health [157].

      1.2.6.1. Pro:
      Bob Ross and "The Joy of Painting [158]" TV show encouraged millions of people [159] to pick up painting as a hobby, helping them relieve stress and improve their cognitive abilities [160].

      1.2.6.2. Pro:

        1.2.6.2.2. Pro:
        The 2023 Women's World Cup inspired young girls, and older women alike, to pursue an interest in football [163].

        1.2.6.2.3. Con:
        Watching run-of-the-mill daily sporting matches on television is not correlated [164] with an increase in physical activity, suggesting that people who watch sport are not physically active.

      1.2.6.3. Con:
      People who are very interested in sports will likely pursue the sport both in person and on TV, making the overall amount of time they watch TV unlikely to go down.

  1.3. Con:
  TV can be an educational tool.

    1.3.1. Con:
    TV can only be educational if one is deliberately tuned into an educational program.

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      One can learn from any number of shows; the program does not need to be explicitly educational for people to learn.

        1.3.1.1.1. Con:
        Subtle lessons displayed in some programming options might not be understood by everyone watching, lessening their value.

        1.3.1.1.2. Pro:
        Movies like The Godfather educate viewers about how mafias operate and serve as a warning about violence being a counterproductive tool [165] to achieve one's desired ends.

        1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
        Many TV shows have incidental educational value [166], which can help to educate viewers without being the main focus of the program.

      1.3.1.2. Pro:
      With the popularity of more entertaining and instantly gratifying channels displaying sports [167], movies or reality TV [168], there is little to convince viewers to watch educational content.

        1.3.1.2.1. Con:
        Watching sports [169] on TV can teach strategy, competitiveness, and teamwork.

    1.3.2. Con:
    Fictional programmes have higher ratings [170], thereby reducing the incentive to produce educational ones.

      1.3.2.1. Con:
      TV shows can be both entertaining and educational, such as Sesame Street [171].

        1.3.2.1.1. Con:
        Sesame Street is one of the best TV shows of all time, continuing to win awards [172] more than 50 years after it started. The remainder of TV programming cannot possibly live up to such a high standard.

        1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
        Infotainment is an entire genre of television that intends to present information in an entertaining way [173].

      1.3.2.2. Con:
      There are important incentives to produce educational content besides ratings or money. Documentaries can be used to generate awareness for an issue [174] and merely provide the good of education.

      1.3.2.3. Pro:
      Production budgets for TV shows can be upwards of millions of dollars per hour [175]. With such large investments, producers aim to create programs with high ratings to ensure a return.

      1.3.2.4. Pro:
      Channels that were formerly predominantly education-focused in the past, such as Discovery, have now pivoted to focus on reality TV [176].

        Between one- and three-quarters [178] of people around the world get their news from social media.

        1.3.3.1.2. Con:
        Distrust of social media is rampant; approximately one-third of US adults [179] never get their news from social media.

      1.3.3.2. Con:
      With just six corporations owning 90% of the media [180] in the US, it is highly unlikely television will broadcast an unbiased and full spectrum of information.

        1.3.3.2.1. Pro:
        In the US, 40% of local news channels [181] are owned by Sinclair Broadcasting; they have used their power to push political agendas in the past.

      1.3.3.3. Pro:
      Many news networks broadcast 24-hour news programming [182], providing people with access to immediate reporting and commentary on events, oftentimes as they unfold at any time of the day or night.

      1.3.3.4. Pro:
      Multiple studies suggest that watching TV can lead to beneficial educational outcomes.

        1.3.3.4.1. Pro:
        Watching high-quality television dramas can increase our ability to read other people's emotions [183].

          1.3.3.4.1.1. Con:
          People reading literature is at least equally, if not more, able to help them increase empathy [184]. TV is far from essential in this regard.

        1.3.3.4.2. Pro:
        Children who watched TV three or more hours per day were three months ahead [185] of those who watched less than one hour per day.

        1.3.3.4.3. Pro:
        A combination of visual and verbal [186] information on television is an effective learning tool.

        1.3.3.4.4. Con:
        Children who watch more than two hours of television a day, especially those with a TV in their own rooms [187], scored significantly lower on standardized tests than their counterparts.

          1.3.3.4.4.1. Con:
          The same research study found that there was no consistent negative association between test scores and hours spent watching TV [188].

            1.3.3.4.4.1.1. Con:
            Test scores are not a useful form [189] of demonstrating educational achievement.

      1.3.3.5. Pro:
      Not only does the media help form and promote [190] feelings of national pride, but it also acts as a way for citizens of other nations to experience other countries and cultures.

        1.3.3.5.1. Pro:
        TV shows and movies help spread cultural values.

        1.3.3.5.2. Con:
        Over-dependence on foreign production [191] (e.g in third world countries) is a form of cultural domination.

      1.3.3.6. Con:
      Many viewers [192] think the educational quality of TV shows is generally poor.

        1.3.3.6.1. Pro:
        Many programmes are described as documentaries even though they are fictional [193].

        1.3.3.6.2. Pro:
        TV decreases the intelligence of viewers.

          1.3.3.6.2.1. Pro:
          The more time spent watching television during childhood and adolescence, the less likely [194] people are to finish school with qualifications or attain a university degree.

          1.3.3.6.2.2. Pro:
          Oftentimes, the people who watch the most TV have impaired mental abilities [195].

          1.3.3.6.2.3. Pro:
          TV impairs language skills in children.

            1.3.3.6.2.3.1. Pro:
            When children watch TV, it impairs their language acquisition because it tends to displace opportunities [196] for live conversation time between them and adults.

            1.3.3.6.2.3.2. Pro:
            TV has been shown to negatively affect the frontopolar area [197] of the brain, impacting the verbal abilities of children.

            1.3.3.6.2.3.3. Con:
            People in non-English-speaking countries watch American sitcoms [198] with subtitles to learn English [199].

              1.3.3.6.2.3.3.1. Con:
              American sitcoms are often broadcast abroad with the audio dubbed over [200], lessening their usefulness as a resource for learning English.

              1.3.3.6.2.3.3.2. Con:
              The popularity of American sitcoms contributes to the Americanization [201] of the English language, which could erase smaller English dialects, such as Scottish English [202] and Hiberno-English (p. 57 [203]).

          1.3.3.6.2.4. Con:
          Throughout history, people have claimed that different pastimes and new technology is contributing to a decline in intelligence. This does not mean that it is the case.

            1.3.3.6.2.4.1. Pro:
            Plato argued that writing would cause people to have no memories, and make people stupider [204].

            1.3.3.6.2.4.2. Pro:
            Some have argued that ubiquitous access to calculators [205] is killing the ability for people to do math in their heads.

            1.3.3.6.2.4.3. Con:
            Technology tends to help simplify processes, freeing up brainpower [206] for people to achieve greater heights and further advance technology.

        1.3.3.6.3. Pro:
        TV executives want dramas to be dumbed down [207] with simplistic storylines in order to cater to passive watchers.

        Kids watching Shark Tank [212] may be inspired to open a business of their own.

        1.3.4.1.2. Con:
        Innovation and capital investment existed long [213] before television and shows like Shark Tank or Dragons' Den.

      1.3.4.2. Con:
      TV rots the brain [214]; people who watch significant amounts of TV are unlikely to be the next inspirational figure, found a company, or spur technological innovation.

    1.3.5. Pro:
    TV shows can inspire children to pursue an interest in science and technology.

      1.3.5.1. Pro:
      Science shows like Beakman's World [215] inspire children to get interested in science by teaching them facts and concepts that they might otherwise find boring or intimidating.

      1.3.5.2. Pro:
      President Obama thanked the cast of Mythbusters [216] for inspiring young people to pursue the sciences.

      1.3.5.3. Con:
      TV has a detrimental effect on grades [217], making an interest in science or technology meaningless without the grades to further pursue these fields.

      1.3.5.4. Con:
      Many science-related TV shows are unrealistic [218] and could cause people to dedicate their lives to a career that was inaccurately portrayed on TV.

        1.3.5.4.1. Con:
        Shows began to hire scientific advisors [219] in the 1970s to make their productions more accurate and believable, inspiring a new generation of scientists.

  1.4. Pro:
  TV worsens a number of societal ills.

    1.4.1. Pro:

      1.4.1.1. Pro:
      The stereotypes used in advertising display gender discrimination.

        1.4.1.1.1. Con:

      1.4.1.3. Con:
      Some TVs and most DVRs have the option to block, filter, fast-forward, or skip [228] TV ads.

      1.4.1.4. Con:

    TV sexualizes people.

      1.4.2.1. Con:
      All forms of media, including painting and sculpture [231], have been accused of sexualizing people. It is a greater reflection of humanity than the means by which sexualization occurs.

      Heavy television viewers [232] have more permissive views regarding sex, abortions, and homosexuality.

      1.4.2.3. Pro:

        1.4.2.3.1. Con:
        Pornography is far more dangerous [234] in this manner—many places have already banned it as a result, while TV has not suffered the same fate.

      1.4.2.4. Pro:
      Exposure to sex on television has been linked [235] with sexual initiation at a younger age.

    Smart TVs threaten people's privacy.

      1.4.3.1. Con:
      People could opt to use an older tube or flat-screen TV without internet connectivity and newer technologies, rather than a smart TV [238].

        1.4.3.1.1. Con:
        Older TVs are less energy efficient [239] and have poor resolutions compared to newer models.

        1.4.3.1.2. Pro:
        TVs undergo a high degree of depreciation [240], allowing people to buy high-quality older premium models at the same price as modern sets of lower quality.

        1.4.3.1.3. Con:
        Most of the 'cable' providers in the Netherlands provide TV via internet connection [241], so one cannot really go without a smart TV.

        1.4.3.1.4. Pro:
        A regular TV with a plug-in streaming device [242] would be a reasonable solution to prevent spying.

          1.4.3.1.4.1. Con:
          With the exception of Apple TV and Nvidia Shield TV, most streaming players spy on their users [243].

            1.4.3.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            Roku, one of the most popular streaming devices, collects massive amounts of data [244] and could be used to spy on consumers just as easily as a smart TV.

          1.4.3.1.4.2. Con:
          The need to purchase and install an additional device is not an ideal solution for people on a budget.

            1.4.3.1.4.2.1. Con:
            Most add-on streaming devices are inexpensive [245] and affordable to people on a budget.

          1.4.3.1.4.3. Pro:
          Most people [246] use plug-in external streaming devices with their TV, regardless of whether or not it has smart capabilities.

        1.4.3.1.5. Con:
        In order to keep up with the latest upgrades in quality people will probably be forced to buy [247] a newer smart TV, regardless.

        1.4.4.4.1. Pro:

          1.4.4.4.1.1. Pro:
          Secular commentators also described controversial shows, such as Little Britain, as "offensive trash [259]" which featured blackface, and mocked women, the disabled, and homosexuals.

          1.4.4.4.1.2. Con:
          Religious principles are no longer the means of measurement of social moral standards.

        1.4.4.4.2. Pro:
        Heavy television viewers, those who view for four hours or more per evening [260], are less committed to moral values like empathy and honesty.

        1.4.4.4.3. Con:
        TV shows can be used to explore, teach, and strengthen moral philosophies [261].

          1.4.4.4.3.1. Pro:
          Kids' TV shows are particularly adept at teaching moral lessons [262] to children.

            1.4.4.4.3.1.1. Con:
            The moral lessons taught to children by TV shows may need additional reinforcement and explanation [263] from adults, suggesting that TV might not be the best medium for the transmission of these messages.

    1.4.5. Con:
    TV shows and movies often pay homage to people who have made sacrifices for others. In doing so, they promote empathy, compassion, and altruism.

      1.4.5.1. Con:
      TV shows and movies consistently misrepresent [264] people from history, doing them a disservice by promoting misinformation and occasionally, outright lies.

        1.4.5.1.1. Pro:
        Many movies are full of historical inaccuracies [265] which alter the course of history to fit the version told by the director and screenplay writers.

      1.4.5.2. Pro:
      Many of the stories told on TV and in movies are true stories that were nearly forgotten to history [266].

        1.4.5.2.1. Con:
        Books, newspapers, magazines, and print media in general are equally, or better, able to cover millions of amazing stories which were nearly lost to history.

        1.4.5.2.2. Pro:
        The scene at the end of The Titanic with the couple cuddling in bed as the water rises around them is based on the true story [267] of an old wealthy couple who gave up their lifeboat so that others might live.

        1.4.5.2.3. Pro:
        Some of the best war movies, such as Schindler's List, Hacksaw Ridge, and Dunkirk, are true stories. Many audiences learned some nearly-forgotten history [268] from these films.

    1.4.6. Con:
    TV brings people together.

      1.4.6.1. Pro:
      Families often use TV as a means to come together and build up their relationships.

        1.4.6.1.1. Pro:
        Expanded screen size and enhanced TV technologies have helped bring families back together [269] in the living room, instead of being off in separate rooms.

          1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro:
          A group of people watching the same TV consume the same programming at the same time. This facilitates discussion and live reaction/interaction between each viewer.

            1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            Unlike theater, people can pause or speak over the TV without interfering with the performance, facilitating discussion or commentary throughout the show or movie without taking away from the action.

        1.4.6.1.2. Pro:
        Sitting down together in front of the TV was regarded as the best way of catching up by more than half of families [270]. A further 12% claimed it was the only time they were ever together in one room.

        1.4.6.1.3. Con:
        A group of people watching TV merely brings them together physically; without interacting with one another, there is no value added in simply being near someone else.

          1.4.6.1.3.1. Con:
          Parents having physical contact with their children can bring them closer together [271].

      1.4.6.2. Con:
      TV can be used to influence [272] people with biased information [273] and prevent them from escaping from their information silos [274]. This worsens political polarisation.

        1.4.6.2.1. Pro:
        The act of watching TV makes people more passive [275] and accepting of authority.

        1.4.6.2.2. Pro:
        Subliminal messaging on TV is often used to sell products, which can often times be harmful, such as energy drinks and alcohol [276].

          1.4.6.2.2.1. Con:
          Subliminal messaging does not impact everyone [277] in the same way; most people are oblivious to it.

          1.4.6.2.2.2. Pro:
          Subliminal messaging [278] has been a part of Coca-Cola and many other corporations' advertising campaigns.

        1.4.6.2.3. Pro:
        More than 91 million viewers in Brazil, the equivalent of the audience for the Super Bowl, tune into just one channel [279] every night; the owner of the network can exert a significant amount of control over what those people see.

        1.4.6.2.4. Con:
        Claims of media bias are generally overblown [280].

          1.4.6.2.4.1. Pro:
          Watching a variety of channels, content, and news sources can help someone avoid getting stuck in an information bubble.

          1.4.6.2.4.2. Con:
          The CIA has a history [281] of influencing public opinion through the media, for instance with Operation Mockingbird [282].

        1.4.6.2.5. Con:
        This is not a failure of TV, but rather a failure of people to apply critical thinking [283] to their media consumption.

      1.4.6.3. Pro:
      For some couples with busy personal and professional lives, watching TV is the only time they spend together.

        1.4.6.3.1. Con:
        The biggest cause of fights [284] for couples is over who controls the remote; changing the channel even led a man to kill his wife [285].

        1.4.6.3.2. Pro:
        Cuddling on the couch while watching TV is important for bonding and relationship building [286].

        1.4.6.3.3. Con:
        One quarter of couples are unable to agree on which show to watch and separate themselves to watch TV in different rooms [287].

          1.4.6.3.3.1. Con:
          Half of all couples [288] sit on the same couch and watch TV together.

        1.4.6.3.4. Pro:
        Couples who watch TV together have stronger relationships [289].

    1.4.7. Pro:
    Violence on TV [290] is blamed for causing viewers to imitate violence and leads to an increase [291] in real-world violence and aggression.

      1.4.7.1. Pro:
      The widespread coverage of war, violence, murder, economic crisis, etc., on TV has negative effects on the collective consciousness [292].

      1.4.7.2. Con:
      As TV watching is so ubiquitous [293], finding a control group against which to test the causal link between TV and violence is quite difficult.

        1.4.7.2.1. Con:
        Young people watch far less TV [294] compared to older people—they could be used as a control group in a study.

        1.4.7.2.2. Con:
        Many countries require television users to pay a TV license fee [295]. Those who do not pay this fee could be established as a control group, as they likely do not have a television.

          1.4.7.2.2.1. Con:
          Tens of thousands of people opt not to pay [296] for their license, yet continue to watch and consume TV.

        1.4.7.2.3. Pro:
        People who don't watch TV would likely be excluded from any potential study based on factor, like illiteracy or poverty level, that mark them as distinct from other participants.

      1.4.7.3. Con:
      Many things such as sporting events [297], alcohol [298], and marriage [299] can lead to increased violence and aggression, however they are not condemned as inherently bad.

      1.4.7.4. Pro:
      Violent Turkish TV shows [300] have been blamed for increased violence against women.

      1.4.7.5. Pro:
      The aggression displayed on some reality shows [301] can cause an increase in aggression in viewers, to a higher extent than exposure to violent media, including crime dramas.

The number of newspaper newsroom employees dropped by 57 percent from 2008 to 2020, according to a Pew Research study, leading to thousands of “ghost newspapers” that barely cover their community."

"If you are of a certain age, you remember TVs with Picture-in-Picture. This was one of the most popular features that seemed to be the future of TV. 

...

Why did people want PiP in the first place? The answer is time. When multiple shows were simultaneously broadcast on different networks, it was possible to miss one show while watching another. PiP allowed you to at least watch the second during the commercials for the first. A couple of things came around that eliminated that need.

The first, and most important, was DVRs. DVRs (Digital Video Recorders) allowed you to record multiple shows even if they were playing at the same time. You could then watch them back later. If you were using PiP simply watch something else during commercials, DVRs also helped. They allowed you to skip the commercials. Another nail in the PiP coffin.

Add streaming services and devices with multiple functions and consumer interest in Picture-in-Picture evaporated."

"Especially in developing countries, achieving it depends on policies specifically targeted to meet the needs of the poor. The best way for governments to ensure that a growing number of people will be able to afford commercial energy in line with their needs is to pursue policies which accelerate economic growth, trade with neighbouring markets, and a more equitable income distribution. This requires increasing reliance on the market, while addressing cases of market failure with special policies. An energy tariff reflecting all costs, including external costs such as emissions and waste management, is necessary to secure adequate investment and to encourage energy efficiency and environmentally preferred technologies. However, such a tariff would be unaffordable for many people in developing countries. There may therefore be a need, in some cases, to subsidise energy technology and delivery for a period of time, without creating price distortions or at least keeping them to a minimum."

"Part of the enduring charm of Emily in Paris is the show’s ability to provide a light-hearted escape or retreat from the real world. This aspect of the show may render it “bad” to the critical viewer, but to its fans, this is one of its winning qualities. Silliness is often the best method of absorbing an audience, as it provides a distancing from any claims at realism. Emily’s story invites viewers into a world of Parisian color and chaos, disconnected from reality in the best possible way. Artful shots of pristine Paris streets and a sparkling Eiffel Tower, combined with almost exclusively sunny weather, render the show cartoonish in its immersive make-up. For an audience looking to watch something straightforward at the end of a busy day, this removal of realism and the need for critical thinking from the viewing experience can be a welcomed one."

Some of the greatest escape shows are those that bring audiences into an entirely different world, from the space adventures in Star Trek to the bloody wars of Game of Thrones. Even shows based on the everyday world can make people forget their troubles, even if that means focusing on the obstacles of the characters. The best shows to help viewers escape reality are the ones with fascinating characters and a seductive world of intrigue."
[40] https://thoughteconomics.com/the-role-of-philosophy-in-life/
"Philosophy is embedded in everything. We all have philosophies which form the basis for our motivations and what we do with our days. Everyone has their own philosophy of life; every institution has a philosophy. Donald Trump has a philosophy, Walmart will have a philosophy, Playboy magazine will have a philosophy, your next-door neighbour will have a philosophy… but for most of us, those philosophies are unexamined and more or less automatic and instinctual.

Philosophy as a named activity, is quite recent in human history- and is the attempt to examine these instinctive and automatic motivations and say, ‘is this definitely wise?’, ‘is this coherent?’.

We can date the origins of this type of philosophy to Socrates 2500 years ago which is very recent in the history of homo sapiens. This was the period when humans changed from ‘we do this because this is the way it’s always been done, this is the way the gods told us to do things [...] to an active, conscious rational way of thinking."

Furthermore, a review found preliminary evidence that multiple meditation styles can increase attention, memory, and mental quickness in older volunteers.

In addition to fighting normal age-related memory loss, meditation can at least partially improve memory in patients with dementia. It can likewise help control stress and improve coping in those caring for family members with dementia."

"Dumb sitcom characters have long been a staple of television comedies. Some prove so popular and enduring they could easily rank among the greatest TV characters ever, or, at the very least, the funniest. But not every sitcom moron started out that way. Some actually began as quite different characters, so much so that they eventually became unrecognizable from their early appearances. In a way, this is forgivable; after all, characters evolve naturally over the lifespan of a TV show - or, in the case of stupid TV characters, they devolve. In some cases they became so butchered by their own stupidity to the extent that the character, and sometimes even the show itself, suffered greatly."

However, not all TV channels losing their way needs to be seen as a bad thing. Breaking Bad isn't what AMC originally intended to air when it first launched, but it entertains people far more than "classics" like Gone With the Wind.

The annual Ofcom report, titled UK audience attitudes towards broadcast media, found that 30% of the adults surveyed believed that programming quality worsened in 2015.

The main reasons given for the drop in quality were more repeats, a lack of variety and an overall lack of quality in programming.

Just 17% felt that programme quality improved last year. The figures are broadly the same that Ofcom has found each year since 2008."

Communities can exist or be created from a shared location, hobbies, lived experiences and backgrounds, or a common cause.

"Toxic fandom has gotten out of control. In fact, it can be found in almost any fandom. But what happens when that same toxicity hits one of the most storied franchises in television and movie history. Before diving into specifics around the Star Trek franchise, let’s first attempt to define toxic fandom, talk about the different stages of fandom, discuss specific examples of toxicity in the Star Trek Universe, and lastly reflect on how we can be good stewards of the franchise; to foster a more inviting atmosphere for young and old fans alike."

Even when the show wasn’t on, from 1989-2005, fans kept the love for the show going by creating everything from clothing to comics. This hasn’t stopped with the introduction of the Internet. 

If anything, fans have only gotten more creative, writing fanfiction and drawing fanart. Fans can also run entire Twitter or Instagram accounts dedicated to the show. These accounts can include fan edits, discussion of the show with other fans, polls, and more. Doctor Who fans are definitely creative, yet such creativity isn’t the only thing that stands out."

"Thrones is far from the first piece of media to generate a massive fan theory culture — Lost thrived on torturing its audience with cryptic clues and red herrings, and people wrote actual books on what would happen next in the Harry Potter series. Thrones does, however, have the distinction of legitimizing fan theories as a crucial and expected part of each episode’s aftermath.

While some people watch Game of Thrones and take the plot at face value, the effort to predict the show’s next big twist have become a cottage industry unto itself. During and after each episode, Twitter and Reddit light up with posts from superfans who claim to hold the key to the endgame based on line readings and newly revealed information, and online outlets (including Mashable) publish exhaustive analyses that not only sum up what just happened on Game of Thrones, but what might happen next."

Other similar examples where this has happened before include DaVinci Code, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and Lord of the Rings.

While in my mind there is no denying how well written and executed Game of Thrones is; in reality, to most of us, it takes a large network effect for us to see what’s going on primarily due to the Core drive of Social Pressure & Envy.

As more and more people watch and debate about the show, we naturally want to be a part of the action and feel included in these conversations. (aka Bandwagoning)

Twenty five percent of the 189 men reported logging more than 20 hours per week of TV time, Chavarro said. Their sperm counts were 44 percent lower than those of the men who watched little television, the researchers report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The men who reported exercising 14 hours a week or more – enough to get out of breath – had the highest sperm counts.

Reading is critical during these early years, as your children will quickly begin to learn new words and new concepts that will help carry them through the rest of their lives, and even set them ahead of the learning curve."

Reading requires much more thinking than television. Reading improves a child’s vocabulary. A decrease in reading scores may be related to too much time in front of the TV.

 40 percent for each additional 2 hours of daily TV watching; and

"It finally hit me one day during my AP English class, while everyone was handing in an in-class essay that they had been preparing for weeks, that I spent my study time binge-watching Scandal and House of Cards on Netflix. The reason why I was making such an idiotic choice that was impacting my studies and grades so negatively? Escapism.

When trying to understand myself and after multiple google searches, I had found a research paper by Bernd Henning and Peter Vorderer, that stated “Kubey notes that the research literature “has made it clear that television is an activity likely to be chosen by people wishing to escape from negative feelings and from the demands of reality.””

It finally all made sense in my head. I wanted so badly to escape from the pressures and stress that comes along with junior year of high school, and I did exactly that. By not focusing on my work, and spending all my time watching shows and movies, I didn’t stress one bit."

"Next, we took a closer look at which specific shows on TV were responsible for the largest share of references to drugs and alcohol.

Unsurprisingly, Cops ranked first on the list. The show documents police responses to illegal activities, often showing the consequences of drug use or drug-related offenses. These include disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and public intoxication. Indeed, four of the top 10 shows with drug mentions were crime dramas (Bones, CSI, Law & Order: SVU, and Law & Order), and one – ER – was a medical drama that often depicts the injuries and negative aftereffects of drug abuse."

This is driven by the fact that "African-American women were more likely than men to be involved in verbal aggression, both as aggressor and victim," they add.

The study, published in the Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, examined "a composite week of the most popular prime-time broadcast and cable reality TV shows" at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. The researchers examined a single episode of 42 different shows, including The Amazing Race, Shark Tank, Project Runway, Duck Dynasty, Undercover Boss, and Top Chef."

Those who saw the immigration storylines were also more likely to take certain related actions, such as speaking to a friend about immigration issues or attending an immigration-related community event.

“This new data shows how the power of storytelling can engage audiences, shift mindsets, and move people into action,” said Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Jose Antonio Vargas[...]. “We’re calling on creators in the entertainment industry to continue to better develop authentic immigrant characters and storylines, which not only broaden representation, but empower viewers to take action on immigration-related issues.”"

It was an invitation for Clemmons—but also for all Americans to stand in solidarity with the Black community.

Through 1993, Clemmons was featured in 98 episodes of the iconic children's show. He came to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1968, amid a civil-rights movement that eventually led to a symbolic show of Black allyship from its beloved series's namesake, Fred Rogers. Racial tensions were high. Recreational segregation was widely enforced."

"Netflix saw this as an “inefficiency” in the market, Hastings told the Times. No one was wringing rerun value out of those shows, and Netflix’s format was perfect for it. With Netflix, you could watch two or three episodes at once, on-demand, and then pick up where you left off in the narrative the next time. People loved watching shows that way, and it lead to the cultural force we now call “binge-watching.”

At the time, networks saw this as a win-win, since the binge-watching also boosted interest for the current season of the show, sometimes even catapulting it into the national pop culture conversation. Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, told the Times that “‘Breaking Bad’ was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.”

But though Netflix had pioneered the binge, the company knew its relationship with networks wouldn’t stay the same forever."

Michael wails over the body of his dead child in an extended scene that goes on for a lot longer than such scenes are usually allowed to last. It goes on for so long, in fact, that even the other distraught members of the family seem surprised by his grief. We don’t initially hear Michael’s screaming; the sound cuts out, so we only see it, while hearing the immortal Intermezzo from Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana (the opera they’ve all just been watching), which both highlights and tempers the melodramatic intensity of the scene."

"Watching the successful athletes on television enabled me to set my goals on what I wanted to achieve. Unfortunately, I didn’t have plans or a strategy on how to become an athlete, so I remained a dreamer, and a fan.

As I got older, and I developed a competitive attitude, I modeled my competitiveness from my favorite sports teams. I was very happy when my teams would win, and very upset when they would lose. On the difficult side of this, I had the attitude of loyalty, and I stuck with my teams regardless of their winning records. The result of this, I was upset and depressed more often than happy.

In the past few years, as I have been evaluating businesses, and proposing and implementing solutions, my view of sports has changed again. Now I see in sports many of the same attributes I see in businesses. What leads to success in sports, many times also leads to success in business. And conversely, what leads to failure in sports, often leads to failure in business."

"But when it comes to education, our data-collection methods fundamentally haven't changed since the ACT was first introduced in 1959. Unlike our modern methods, tests are decoupled from the action that they are measuring. They don't track the process of learning, but the ability to demonstrate it at a later date. That can be valuable---what good is learning something if you can’t later show that you've learned it?---but it also creates fuzziness in what's being measured.

Take the familiar problem of "teaching to the test." Tests like PARCC aren't just dipstick-like check-ins; teachers and administrators actively adjust their lesson plans specifically to boost test performance. So the tests are measuring the teacher's ability to teach, not general knowledge, but that specific test."

For a BBC facing budget cuts, it makes financial sense to make more documentaries and fewer dramas; documentaries come at a fraction of the price.

Unfortunately, 79 percent of viewers assumed this was a real documentary. But the worst part is that the idea of faking educational documentaries isn't anything new.

English originally arrived in Ireland along with English settlers in the twelfth century, and although Gaelic language and culture experienced a resurgence around 1600, English never died out and returned full-force later in the seventeenth century. To this day, Irish English, or Hiberno-English, retains syntactic and phonetic characteristics of the original Gaelic.

There are five major dialects of Hiberno-English: Local Dublin English, Non-Local Dublin English, West and South-West Irish English, Supraregional Southern Irish English, and Ulster English (Jordan). In order to study syntactic and phonetic qualities of Hiberno-English, the major dialects must first be distinguished from each other."

If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls. They will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks."

"Since the 1980s we have had access to calculators of various types. Today, we can include computers and smartphones – which are attached to our hip 24/7. So does this ubiquitous access to calculators affect our ability to do maths in our heads like we used to?

Thirty years ago calculators promised immense opportunity – opportunity, alas, that brought considerable controversy. The sceptics predicted students would not be able to compute even simple calculations mentally or on paper. Multiplication, basic facts, knowledge would disappear. Calculators would become a crutch.

The controversy has not dissipated over time. As recently as 2012, the UK government announced it intended to ban calculators from primary classrooms on the grounds that students use them too much and too soon."

"But tests of 158 Britons between the ages of 18 and 71 found that putting key details into a phone or device helped improve memory, and meant they could recall unsaved facts.

Dr Sam Gilbert, from University College London, said: “When people had to remember for themselves, they used their memory power to remember the most important information.

“But when they were able to use the device, they saved highly important information on the device and instead used their own memory for less important information.

“Far from causing digital dementia, using an external memory device may even improve our memory.”"

"The institute examined TV ownership, content and regulation in 20 European countries including the UK.

It found a drop in quality of news and cultural reporting in countries where a few companies often control a country's entire TV market and those which have opened up to a flood of commercial broadcasters.

In France, for example, commercial network TF1 attracts almost one-third of the national audience and half of its total TV advertising revenues.

Digital broadcasting could encourage more competition and choice in programming, the report said.

However, as current broadcast regulation does not cover digital broadcasting in most countries, it risks being dominated by a relatively small number of commercial companies.

The Budapest-based institute said governments should not let the market determine broadcasting policy, and should automatically give public service stations licences for digital broadcasting."

True, at a certain point it does seem that people who watch vast amounts of TV do become so intellectually impaired that they start involuntarily clapping along to theme tunes like imprisoned sea lions performing for fish, but that isn’t anything you could write a medical paper about.

Now, sadly, science has trundled along to back it up. According to Dr Ryan Dougherty, from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, the more television you watch in middle age, the lower your volume in grey matter. Examining the viewing habits of 599 American adults between 1990 and 2011, Dougherty found that those who watched an above average amount of television showed reduced volume in their frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Basically, your mum was right: TV really does rot your brain."

"While popular entertainment can inspire and inform, it can also create misconceptions. Many in the scientific community have worried over how such media influence people’s impressions of, support for, and understanding of scientific inquiry, knowledge and careers in these fields. For example, some express concern that Hollywood’s portrayal of science creates unrealistic standards for criminal evidence in the public mind. Although studies about this “CSI effect” remain inconclusive, the issue was deemed serious enough to merit inclusion in a report published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and helped launch an advisory network to connect scientists and engineers with entertainment industry professionals.

"While onscreen depictions of stretchy mutants or a toilet-terrorizing dinosaur may seem completely independent from real-life research, movie and TV production crews have spent decades seeking out scientists to fact-check scripts and special effects. 

Propelled by the science fiction boom beginning in the 1970s, Hollywood has since solicited expert knowledge to make scenes more plausible. 

As it turns out, even the wackiest plots can benefit from some expert knowledge. For example, Anne Simon, a virologist at the University of Maryland and consultant on The X-Files, broke it to the series creator that a virus couldn’t, in fact, theoretically transform into a monster. (It could, however, transform cells into terrifying creatures.)

The benefits go both ways: Conversely, popular media has even helped spark research developments and garner funding in science fields. And in the last decade, it’s become far easier to bridge the worlds of science and fiction"

"[S]mokeless tobacco (SLT) products are safer than cigarettes, but awareness of this potential harm reduction alternative among consumers is low. Therefore, two between-subjects experimental studies explore the potential for allowing the marketing of SLT as a “reduced-risk” alternative to cigarette smoking. Specifically, this article addresses the issue of whether a harm reduction message with the simultaneous presence of the U.S. government-mandated warning would: (1) change intentions of smokers to use SLT products; or (2) attract those who would not otherwise use any tobacco. Results suggest that an advertiser making a harm reduction statement in the presence of the warning leads to limited changes in consumers' risk perceptions of SLT products or intentions to try the product. Exposure to the experimental ads did not make nonsmokers significantly more likely to try SLT products, but also did not make smokers indicate that they were likely to switch to SLT products."

"From ancient to modern art, the hypersexualization of a woman’s body has always been present. Our Paleolithic ancestors created various sculptures and figurines of women emphasizing the sexual parts of the body such as the breasts, stomachs and buttocks. The oversizing of these parts represents the male’s desire and hope.

In 1486, Sandra Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus” portrayed an idealization of body image by painting long, luscious hair, supple skin and large breasts. This was a radical thing to do, since the Renaissance era focused on Christian themed art and nude women were rarely shown. This was the beginning of Western art’s continuation of female nudes.

The list of male artists painting female nudes can continue for pages, but this was not the only issue for women. Aside from being exposed, criticized, and hypersexualized, female artists rarely received recognition for their own artwork."

"Television also tends to portray sexual roles in a stereotypic manner that can set up unrealistic expectations. Sexual scripts for women on television tend to center on women's ability to attain the “right” kind of man and on their success in sexual “gate-keeping” until adequate emotional commitment is secured. Men, on the other hand, are often portrayed as sexual initiators, valued for their sexual prowess, who aggressively seek sex at any cost. Exposure to these portrayals may lead male youth to expect that sex is desirable under any circumstances and female youth to expect that sex will lead to love and commitment, resulting in sexual regret if these expectations are not met."

For most men, consuming porn will not cause them to view women differently. But in those who already are predisposed to hold sexist views or to behave in an aggressive fashion, porn can exacerbate pre-existing and dangerous propensities. In this way, it’s just like any other drug."

In another study, the association between exposure to sex on television and the timing of sexual initiation was found to be partially mediated by teenagers' sexual outcome expectancies.34 Teenagers who viewed more sex on television had more positive expectations about the consequences of having sex; this in turn was associated with a higher likelihood of intercourse initiation. Although this research links exposure to sex on television to early sexual initiation and provides evidence that teenagers' expectations have a role in the relationship, it does not indicate that youth felt disappointed with these initial experiences with sex."

Starting in 2014, Vizio made TVs that automatically tracked what consumers were watching and transmitted that data back to its servers. Vizio even retrofitted older models by installing its tracking software remotely. All of this, the FTC and AG allege, was done without clearly telling consumers or getting their consent.

What did Vizio know about what was going on in the privacy of consumers’ homes? On a second-by-second basis, Vizio collected a selection of pixels on the screen that it matched to a database of TV, movie, and commercial content."

"After a certain amount of time passes, the line between history and legend becomes a little fuzzy. Some of the physical evidence of these bygone times survives and we can piece together how people lived. Mundane information, like clothing, architecture, or daily social protocol often isn't enough to make a movie, and that's where some of the relative anachronism can happen.

Vintage movies about ancient times were usually about Rome and always involved certain famous historic characters that general audiences would already recognize. Since then, the ancient world, on film, has branched out to include comedies, war stories, and serious dramas. These movies don't get everything right, but there's a lot to be said for how they recreate the background, setting, and people of bygone civilizations."

"As the Titanic began sinking into the freezing ocean, women and children were ushered into lifeboats, as was the unwritten law of the sea. But Ida, who was 63, gave up her chance at safety to stay behind with her husband of 40 years, said Kurzman, a social worker and a professor with a dual appointment at Hunter College and at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York.

"My great-grandmother Ida stepped into the lifeboat expecting that her husband would follow. When he didn’t follow, she was very concerned and the ship’s officer in charge of lowering that particular lifeboat said, 'Well, Mr. Straus, you’re an elderly man…and we all know who you are....Of course you can enter the lifeboat with your wife,'" Kurzman told TODAY.

"And, my great-grandfather said, 'No. Until I see that every woman and child on board this ship is in a lifeboat, I will not enter into a lifeboat myself.'""

"Nothing makes a film more shocking, tragic, or inspiring than the truth. Tons of war movies have been made over the years, but the most hard-hitting ones are usually based on true stories.

These heroic—and oftentimes horrific—tales celebrate the lives of real people who suffered at the hands of war, whether while behind enemy lines, navigating the skies, or even sat at a desk.

Risks were taken, sacrifices were made, and a few people managed to get out on the other side alive. These people have now had their journeys told on the big screen."

"Mr Thickett added: "One of the things that has helped drive strong TV viewing figures is the evolution of television technology.

"In the past 10 years we have seen the development of widescreen television, HD television, screens getting flatter and very importantly screens are getting bigger...

"What this is doing is actually bringing people back into the living room and television is taking on a new role as a family experience whereas 10 years ago, in the early 2000s, we were seeing kids, different members of the family watching different television shows in different rooms using different sets.

"The quality of the TV viewing experience has improved, the choice of channels has improved."

"There is substantial evidence that advertising is effective in changing attitudes. After the R. J. Reynolds Company started airing its Joe Camel ads for cigarettes on TV in the 1980s, Camel’s share of cigarette sales to children increased dramatically. But persuasion can also have more positive outcomes. For instance, a review of the research literature indicates that mass-media anti-smoking campaigns are associated with reduced smoking rates among both adults and youth (Friend & Levy, 2001). Persuasion is also used to encourage people to donate to charitable causes, to volunteer to give blood, and to engage in healthy behaviors."

"Information silos stem from poor communication between departments or teams. When teams fail to share information, each group has to make decisions based on their individual data and objectives.

The problem is a departmental or team project doesn’t exist in a vacuum; they’re all part of a larger purpose. Organizational goals depend on the diverse expertise of different teams, which means everyone needs to understand the big picture. Teams that are cut off from one another can’t work from a single source of truth and get things done efficiently."

"The sense of relaxation ends when the set is turned off, but the feelings of passivity and lowered alertness continue. Survey participants commonly reflect that television has somehow absorbed or sucked out their energy, leaving them depleted. They say they have more difficulty concentrating after viewing than before. In contrast, they rarely indicate such difficulty after reading. Mander strongly disagrees with the idea that TV is merely a window throughwhich any perception, any argument, or reality may pass. Instead, he claims TV is inherently biased by its technology. For a variety of technical reasons, including TV’s need for sharp contrast to maintain interest, Mander explains that authoritarian-based programming is more technically interesting to viewers than democracy-based programming. War and violence may be unpleasant in real life; however, peace and cooperation make for “boring television.” And charismatic authority figures are more “interesting” on TV"

"These rules were apparently drawn up for the benefit of our health and safety[...]. Basically the rules outlaw "images of very brief duration" because of a condition called photosensitive epilepsy that is triggered by flashing images on TVs.

The phenomenon was demonstrated rather graphically last year when a TV cartoon based on Pokemon, a computer game character with strangely flashing eyes, was broadcast in Japan. It led to an unprecedented number of children being hospitalised.

But despite the tight controls, agencies are always trying to experiment with the notion of subliminal communication. Trevor Beattie, the adman behind the Wonderbra posters and the FCUK work for French Connection, cheekily played with the idea in a controversial poster last year for the fashion chain. This actually featured the words "subliminal", "advertising" and "experiment" arranged in such a way, with the first letters highlighted, so as to spell out SEX."
[277] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204644/#sec-a.e.dtitle
"However, little is known about the longevity of these subliminal influences because these studies were focused mainly on immediate effects of subliminal stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that a few exposures to novel subliminal information is sufficient to influence delayed decision-making. The surprising impact of subliminal messages on rational, intentional, conscious behavior lends subliminal protocols to practical applications, of which advertising is just one example."
[278] https://www.businessinsider.com/subliminal-ads-2011-5
"A Harvard study from 1999 employed a similar method to Vicary's -- subjects played a computer game in which a series of words flashed before them for a few thousandths of a second. One set got positive words like "wise," "astute," and "accomplished." The other set got words like "senile," "dependent," and "diseased."

Despite the fact that these words flashed far too quickly to be consciously perceived, those who received positive words exited the room significantly faster than those who got negative words.

However, William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, prominently spoke out against subliminals when the movie adaptation of his book came under fire for including allegedly subliminal messaging. He said, "There are no subliminal images. If you can see it, it's not subliminal."

So do advertisers consciously choose to include subliminal messages in their ads? Can they harness subliminal power to associate their products with sex and power?"

"WHEN the football World Cup begins on June 12th in Brazil, tens of millions of Brazilians will watch the festivities on TV Globo, the country’s largest broadcast network. But for Globo it will be just another day of vast audiences. No fewer than 91m people, just under half the population, tune in to it each day: the sort of audience that, in the United States, is to be had only once a year, and only for the one network that has won the rights that year to broadcast American football’s Super Bowl championship game.

Globo is surely Brazil’s most powerful company, given its reach into so many homes. Its nearest competitor in free-to-air television, Record, has an audience share of only about 13%. America’s most popular broadcast network, CBS, has a mere 12% share of audience during prime time, and its main competitors have around 8%."

"We found that journalists were just as likely to respond to very conservative candidates as very progressive candidates. Journalists also weren’t more interested in covering a candidate of their own ideology.
[...]
Our research also shows that there is no bias regarding which candidates newspapers cover. Additionally, there are only small shifts in the tone of coverage of one of the most polarizing news topics – Trump. Most newspaper coverage is moderate and exhibits few easily identifiable biases.

Contrary to President Trump’s claims, we find little blatant news bias in what the media covers and how it covers it. While the nature of politics encourages politicians to undermine negative coverage through claims of bias, our research suggests that ideological bias in U.S. newspapers is largely nonexistent."

"Critical thinking is a process in which someone evaluates an issue from multiple perspectives to be critical and logical in their evaluation. In critical thinking, one asks critical questions that lead to developing a critical understanding of a problem.

When herd mentality is becoming increasingly and frighteningly common, critical thinking is becoming rarer and more sought after than ever. Being able to think critically means that you can take your beliefs through the filters of logic. It also means that you are capable of constant introspection, clarity, and an independent mindset."

"When people face adversities in their love life or marriage, they blame many factors including lack of love or sex, time constraint or incompatibility, etc. According to experts, couples raise the alarm when they find sexual intercourse has been missing from their life for a while, a long while to be precise. In a state of anxiety, they end up believing that if they somehow bring back the lost passion between the sheets, their relationship too would magically heal. But they are far from the truth. According to a new research, the frequency of cuddling is a better indicator of a happy and healthy relationship than the frequency at which the couples have sex. Which means, the more you cuddle, the stronger your relationship would grow."

"A quarter of cohabiting couples have admitted they won't let their loved one come between them and their favourite TV show.

Rather than missing an episode of a much-loved soap or the chance to see their football team play on TV, couples will view their channel of choice in separate rooms. 

New research has revealed that a quarter of cohabiting couples spend as many as three evenings in an average week sat in separate rooms in order to watch their desired television shows."

"According to a recent study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationship, those who spoon on the sofa to watch episode after episode (after episode...) of their favourite show are more committed to each other than those who actually make Saturday night plans.

Research suggests that this is down to creating a "shared social identity" through pop culture references whether you're forever quoting Friends or can't help but hit pause for lengthy debates mid-documentary. 

In turn, these joint small screen experiences allow couples to "expand their partner's traits, skills and resources" - a process known as self-expansion."

"As a result of 15 years of “consistently disturbing” findings about the violent content of children’s programs, the Surgeon General’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior was formed in 1969 to assess the impact of violence on the attitudes, values, and behavior of viewers. The resulting report and a follow-up report in 1982 by the National Institute of Mental Health identified these major effects of seeing violence on television:

 Children may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others.
 Children may be more fearful of the world around them.
 Children may be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways toward others."

"Findings of nearly four decades of cultivation research on television message systems have unveiled a ‘distorted’ reality: exaggerated crime rates, overrepresentation of violence, gender-role stereotyping, nontraditional family composition, the ‘mean world syndrome,’ and so on (Morgan et al., 2009). This misshaped, yet repetitive represented ‘reality,’ gradually dominates the worldview of heavy viewers, who rely on television as their main source of beliefs and values."

"First introduced in 1928, the levy generates most of the BBC’s income and is used to pay presenters’ salaries and fund news and entertainment programmes. However, the BBC’s most recent annual report showed the number of individuals opting to pay it had fallen by 500,000, to 24.3 million.

The cost of a TV licence – currently £159 a year – is due to begin rising with inflation in 2024 after the Government’s two-year freeze comes to an end.

Not paying for a licence when you should have is a crime. Almost 1,000 people a week (70pc of them women) are prosecuted for failing to pay for their licence, The Telegraph revealed earlier this year.

Unlike the non-payment of utility bills and parking tickets, which are treated as civil matters, those who refuse to pay the television licence receive a criminal record and the details can show up on an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check – although that is unlikely."

"The high representation of violent behaviours in TV series normalises violent actions while making them attractive to the audiences. According to “Kadın Cinayetlerini Durduracağız (We Will Stop Femicide)” platform’s 2020 report, 182 women have been killed by men in the first seven months of 2020 in Turkey. According to the platform’s data, firearms were frequently used as a weapon. On the other hand, the death reason for 100 women remains suspicious. The same platform reported 474 women killed by men in 2019.

As BBC Turkish published on one of their online news platforms, Canan Güllü, who is the president of the Federation of Women’s Associations of Turkey, stated that a lot of Turkish women called the federation in 2011 to report that they were raped in the same way that the woman character raped in one of the Turkish series.
