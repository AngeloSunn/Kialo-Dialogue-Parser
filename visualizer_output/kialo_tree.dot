    "1 [st-1]
A child doesn't owe his parents
something for getting raised by them.";
    "1.1 [st-2]
Having demands to your children with the
argument that you raised them puts
unhealthy mental stress on them.";
    "1.1.1 [st-3]
Parents often try to enforce their own
demands upon their children by
emphasising how much they have done for
their children.";
    "1.1.1.1 [st-4]
This can include limiting a child's
career options by forcing them to pick a
career path that their parents most
prefer.";
    "1.1.1.2 [st-5]
Parents' demands are usually designed to
encourage children to push themselves
and reach their maximum potential.
Parents want the best for their children
and this comes through in their demands.";
    "1.2 [st-6]
It is a lot of effort to raise children
and they should be thankful to their
parents.";
    "1.2.1 [st-7]
This thankfulness should be earned and
voluntary. It should not be a cultural
demand.";
    "1.2.2 [st-8]
There are personal benefits to showing
gratitude towards others.";
    "1.2.2.1 [st-9]
People who practise gratitude are more
optimistic and happier [1].";
    "1.2.2.2 [st-10]
Knowledge of the benefits of showing
gratitude does not affect a person's
ability to genuinely feel gratitude.";
    "1.2.3 [st-11]
Practising gratitude has significant
social benefits.";
    "1.2.3.1 [st-12]
Expressing gratitude makes people feel
less lonely [2] and isolated.";
    "1.3 [st-13]
Currently, the economy is favoring the
older generations. So by no means are
current children able to monetarily give
to their parents, as their own welfare
will be difficult.";
    "1.3.1 [st-14]
Millennials [3] currently have more debt
than any other generation in history. It
it therefore highly unlikely that they
will be financially equipped to care for
ailing parents.";
    "1.4 [st-15]
Children don't decide to be born.";
    "1.4.1 [st-16]
Parents sign up to bring up the children
when they choose to have children.
Children do not sign up to any such
responsibility and hence should not be
held accountable.";
    "1.4.2 [st-17]
Parents who decide to have children know
the implications that come with brining
up children. As a result, they make an
informed choice and should not be able
to demand things in return.";
    "1.4.2.1 [st-18]
Many people end up having children
without ever choosing to have them.";
    "1.4.2.1.1 [st-19]
The global rate [4] of unintended
pregnancy was estimated at 44% of all
pregnancies between 2010 and 2014.";

Not opting to terminate a pregnancy is
still a choice that results in people
having a baby.";
    "1.4.2.1.1.1.1 [st-21]
Many countries [5] have banned abortion
and hence people are not able to opt out
of having children if they end up
getting pregnant.";
    "1.4.3 [st-22]
A lack of choice is not a good way of
determining someone's obligations to
others.";
    "1.4.3.1 [st-23]
Parents don't choose to ail and need
care as they get older either. Everyone
lacks choice in one way or another.";
    "1.4.3.2 [st-24]
Most children would likely say they are
glad to be alive, irrespective of their
lack of choice. Given this, it is
unreasonable for them to deny certain
obligations arising from their existence
as if their life were a burden.";
    "1.5 [st-25]
Although there are exceptions, it is a
basic instinct for parents to rear their
children.";
    "1.5.1 [st-26]
The only thing any parent should expect
from their child is respect and honesty.
As a parent you are to model behaviour
and should then be saving for retirement
in order not to burden your children.";
    "1.6 [st-27]
Taking care of your child should be
self-evident and not connected to
demands to your child.";
    "1.6.1 [st-28]
Having children with the expectation to
get something from them is immoral.";
    "1.6.1.1 [st-29]
If parents have children only to get
something in return, then they are using

only be treated as an end.";

Not all people subscribe to Kantian
ethics.";
    "1.6.1.2 [st-32]
Even if the expectation of reward is
itself immoral, the child can still be
morally indebted to their parents.";
    "1.6.1.2.1 [st-33]
It is immoral to expect things of one's
child because it is an imposition on the
child's moral agency. By contrast, there
might be independent moral reasons for
the child to owe his parents for raising
them.";
    "1.6.1.2.1.1 [st-34]
For a child's moral agency to be intact,
the child must be able to internally
rationalise what his moral duties ought
to be and freely act on them. The
pressure of parental expectations likely
interrupts this process.";
    "1.6.1.2.1.1.1 [st-35]
There is no practical way to avoid the
influence of parental expectations in
the development of a child's sense of
morality.";
    "1.6.1.2.1.2 [st-36]
A child's moral agency is inherently
interwoven [7] with their parents' sense

In the UK, if the elderly meet a certain
financial threshold, then the local
authority [10] will pay for their care
home.";

In the UK, care for the elderly is in

are likely dependent on their children
for support in their old age.";
