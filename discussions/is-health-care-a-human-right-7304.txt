Is health care a human right?

1. Thesis:
Health care should be considered a human right.

  1.1. Con:
  Declaring healthcare as a human right is economically unfeasible.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    Health care, if considered a human right, forces others in society to bear costs they did not cause.

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      Food is a basic human necessity and a human right, and farmers are similarly expected to provide for the rest of humanity.

        1.1.1.1.1. Con:
        The US has opposed [1] international calls to consider food as a human right.

          1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
          The USA is an outlier as it refuses to ratify many otherwise-globally-accepted treaties such as the Conventaion against Torture [2], the Arms Trade Treaty [3], Convention on the Rights of the Child [4], Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [5], and even the treaty on treaties [6].

        1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
        Governments frequently act as monopsonistic buyers [7] in the agricultural market to ensure food security, even to the detriment of farmers.

        1.1.1.1.3. Con:
        Unlike healthcare, sourcing, obtaining, and preparing food can be done independently, without relying on others.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Citizens bear the cost of health care through taxation, which is a fair payment in exchange for the government's provision of services.

        1.1.1.2.1. Con:
        Healthcare professionals also bear the cost of health care as a human right through a loss in wage.

          1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          Health care professionals cannot negotiate for higher wages [8] if the government is the sole employer of doctors and nurses.

          1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          Doctors in the private sector earn a higher income [9] than those working in the public sector.

          1.1.1.2.1.3. Con:
          If doctors start exiting the healthcare market, the government is likely to incentivize them to stay within the system to maintain supply.

            1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
            The government similarly sustains a network of professionals and maintains an extensive infrastructure to ensure the people's right to a fair trial [10].

              1.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              Paying for and maintaining a network of public hospitals and professionals through taxation to ensure the people's right to health care is similar to sustaining public defenders [11] and prosecutors [12].

              1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con:
              More than 90% [13] of the cases never get to a jury, and the prosecutors have enormous leeway in selecting which transgressions they will bring to trial.

                1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con:
                This doesn't contradict the fact that every defendant has the right to an attorney, state-funded if necessary.

            1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con:
            Doctors often relocate [14] abroad to access higher salaries in the private market.

          1.1.1.2.1.4. Con:
          Passion often drives career choices, not just money; people are motivated by their love for the work, and not necessarily salaries.

        1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
        Taxation funds government, which allocates resources based on citizens' demands.

        1.1.1.2.3. Con:
        Being unable to opt out of paying taxes and not having a say in how they are allocated equals compulsion to support something unwanted.

          1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          Forcing individuals to pay for something they do not support violates their individual liberty to choose how to spend their money.

          1.1.1.2.3.2. Con:
          A person can have a say in how taxes are spent by voting for a representative who aligns with their desired allocation [15] of funds.

            1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con:
            Majority rule, making decisions based on preferences of the majority, may devolve into mob rule and not adequately protect minority rights.

            1.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
            Representatives are accountable to their constituents and consider their preferences when allocating public funds.

      1.1.1.3. Pro:
      Other individuals' poor lifestyle choices force healthy people to bear the costs.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        Individual choices, like smoking, raise the risk of future illnesses and drive up healthcare expenses.

          1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
          Individual choices, such as smoking, already come at a greater cost to people due to increased taxation [16] by the state.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
            The tax burden of universal healthcare is likely to be the same for every citizen, regardless of their smoking habits.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro:
            Taxation on unhealthy foods can potentially reduce diet-related health conditions [17] such as obesity and heart disease, while also generating additional revenue to fund public healthcare systems.

          1.1.1.3.1.2. Con:
          People are often coerced into adopting unhealthy habits such as smoking due to aggressive marketing.

            1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
            Tobacco advertisements make smoking appear appealing [18], increasing the likelihood of people taking up the habit.

            1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con:
            Many countries around the world have complete or partial bans [19] on tobacco advertising.

            1.1.1.3.1.2.3. Con:
            It is not the government's responsibility to regulate or monitor people's vulnerability to drug use through persuasive advertisements.

          1.1.1.3.1.3. Con:
          It cannot be stated with certainty that unhealthy habits such as smoking wholly cause a given disease.

            1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro:
            Some people may be genetically predisposed to specific diseases, meaning that their genes increase their likelihood of developing certain health conditions, regardless of their lifestyle habits.

            1.1.1.3.1.3.2. Pro:
            Unhealthy working conditions, such as those faced by coal miners, can increase a person's risk of developing diseases.

            1.1.1.3.1.3.3. Con:
            While it may be difficult to attribute a particular disease entirely to smoking, there is a strong correlation [20] between smoking and various health conditions, such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart disease.

            1.1.1.3.1.3.4. Con:
            The risk of developing smoking-related diseases decreases [21] after quitting smoking, supporting the link between smoking and disease.

          1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro:
          If treated as a civil right, people won't take responsibility for unhealthy behaviors.

            1.1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro:
            Free healthcare may lead to neglect of personal health due to lack of financial consequences, resulting in a burden on the government funding the care.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con:
              The lack of financial consequences does not equate to the absence of physical repercussions.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.1.2. Con:
              No one would purposely hurt themselves because they could get healthcare for free.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.1.3. Pro:
              People may not take preventative measures for their health, such as regular check-ups and screenings, if they do not perceive a significant financial cost from future illnesses.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.1.4. Pro:
              Without financial consequences, people may engage in riskier behaviors that lead to illness or injury, such as unhealthy diets or dangerous recreational activities.

            1.1.1.3.1.4.2. Con:
            Most people are naturally deterred from engaging in unhealthy or risky behavior due to a fear of injury or death.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.2.1. Con:
              A lack of free health care may enhance a person's natural aversion to risky behavior.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro:
              Risk-taking people are likely to behave the same way regardless of their financial situation.

            1.1.1.3.1.4.3. Con:
            Countries can create incentives [22] that nudge people towards better life choices.

              1.1.1.3.1.4.3.1. Con:
              The goal to restrict people from engaging in any behavior that might jeopardize their health is unrealistic.

          1.1.1.3.1.5. Pro:
          If one fails to fulfill their obligation of taking care of their body, it should be fair for them to lose their right to health care.

        1.1.1.3.2. Con:
        Modern societies require citizens to pay for the consequences of others' actions, from funding law enforcement and correctional facilities to financing litter collection.

          1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          It is ethically sound for society to assist its citizens, even if it may require reductions in earnings for a private individual.

          1.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
          Situations where an individual benefits at the disproportionate cost of society, especially when it's an intentional decision, should be minimized.

            1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con:
            Societies trade individual freedoms for security; policing is a traded freedom, and so should be healthcare.

            1.1.1.3.2.2.2. Con:
            Costs borne by individuals for sustaining health care can be minimized.

            1.1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro:
            Paying a cost for security is a response to the external risk of being a victim of crime, and this is not analogous to healthcare.

            1.1.1.3.2.2.4. Pro:
            Shouldering the costs of health care because of a similar expectation within policing would only serve to increase the overall cost burden.

          1.1.1.3.2.3. Con:
          Whether something exists or how widespread its practice is at any given point in time is not an indication of its social utility [23].

            1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro:
            Citizens may be unwilling contributors to law enforcement, because of dissatisfaction, through mandatory taxation.

            1.1.1.3.2.3.2. Con:
            Society is responsible for their choices even if they are poor ones.

          1.1.1.3.2.4. Pro:
          Society has an obligation to promote health for everyone, especially since it already subsidizes [24] behaviors and industries that contribute to poor health (e.g. tax cuts for underpaying corporations and subsidies for sugar [25] and fossil fuels).

        1.1.1.3.3. Pro:
        Unhealthy individuals tend to utilize a disproportionately large share of healthcare resources.

          1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
          Statistically, 1% of the population consistently uses [26] up to 20% of the total health care expenditure in the US, and 5% uses almost 50%.

            1.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con:
            Healthcare should be apportioned by need rather than each person receiving the same amount.

            1.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con:
            If these 1% or 5% have much more serious diseases than the rest, it wouldn't be fair not to give them the support they need.

            1.1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro:
            An aging population drives up [27] health care costs, as older adults tend to have more health problems and require more medical services.

          1.1.1.3.3.2. Con:
          Accepted human rights entitle people to make claims on the resources of others, it just requires prudence in distributing resources, and not, a justification to discard the right.

            1.1.1.3.3.2.1. Con:
            Some human rights are negative rights [28], meaning that they only require that other people don't negate them.

              1.1.1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro:
              The right to live is a negative right, meaning the government is encouraged to do nothing to infringe upon it, unless necessary.

            1.1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro:
            The idea that human rights can only be exercised within certain limits or under certain conditions is not unreasonable; health insurance normally does have certain applicability restrictions [29].

          1.1.1.3.3.3. Con:
          All people will need health care at some point in their lives, and whatever they pay for it today is something they will benefit from in the future.

        1.1.1.3.4. Con:
        There are compounding factors that influence a persons health that are independent of choice.

          1.1.1.3.4.1. Pro:
          People born into poverty are likely to have a less nutritious diet [30], making them more susceptible to diseases.

          1.1.1.3.4.2. Pro:
          An accident can impact [31] a person's long-term health.

          1.1.1.3.4.3. Pro:
          A person's geographic location might place them at the center of an epidemic [32].

          1.1.1.3.4.4. Con:
          Individuals have a responsibility to seek out accurate information and make informed decisions about their health.

          1.1.1.3.4.5. Con:
          Many health conditions, such as heat disease and diabetes, can be managed or even prevented through lifestyle choices and medical interventions.

          1.1.1.3.4.6. Con:
          People are still responsible for making choices on how to manage the preexisting health conditions and what types of treatments to pursue.

          1.1.1.3.4.7. Pro:
          Older people are likely to suffer [33] from a greater number of health issues as a natural consequence of their age.

    1.1.2. Con:
    Widespread provision of health care in a society improves its economy.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      Universal health care would be incredibly costly and therefore detrimental to the economy.

        1.1.2.1.1. Con:
        Many countries provide universal healthcare [34], showing that any detrimental economic effects are not substantial.

          1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Canada has a universal health care system [35], and forecasts a fiscal surplus [36] in 2023.

          1.1.2.1.1.2. Con:
          The cost forecast for universal health coverage in California was more than [37] the state's entire budget.

          1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro:
          There is evidence to suggest that a single-payer system [38] allows for negotiations that would actually drive down [39] the price of services.

          1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro:
          Many countries (e.g., most in Europe) provide healthcare equally to all their citizens funding it with taxes. In this way everyone pays taxes proportionally to what they earn, and everybody gets healthcare. Nobody has to go bankrupt because they can't afford healthcare or medical cost, and the country receives all the money needed to run the healthcare system, which does not "run out" of resources until wages are paid and supplies are bought.

        1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
        Universal healthcare is too expensive.

          1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          Universal healthcare requires a large amount of funding to cover the costs of providing healthcare to every citizen, regardless of their ability to pay.

            1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
            The US health care cost has been growing independent of universal coverage, and recently accounted for nearly 20% of the GDP expenditure. [40]

            1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro:
            Taxes may need to be increased to fund a universal healthcare system, which could lead to opposition from taxpayers who do not want to see an increase in their tax burden.

            1.1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro:
            Universal healthcare in the U.S is estimated to cost over $30 trillion [41] over a decade.

          1.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
          Universal healthcare can be affordable through cost control measures [42], which some countries have implemented.

            1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
            Many cost-control strategies within public healthcare systems have led to wage cuts [43].

          1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro:
          The primary driver of healthcare cost is insurance companies [44], which can be contained in a publicly run healthcare system.

            1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
            Insurance companies are known to overcharge [45] customers even when operating within universal healthcare systems.

            1.1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro:
            Health insurance providers charge customers a premium that exceeds the actual costs they pay to hospitals, driven by their profit motive.

            1.1.2.1.2.3.3. Con:
            Patents in the pharmaceutical industry significantly contribute to healthcare costs by driving up drug prices [46].

            1.1.2.1.2.3.4. Pro:
            Insurance companies are not accountable to the people, unlike governments, and are therefore able to overcharge customers.

            1.1.2.1.2.3.5. Con:
            Insurance companies often negotiate lower prices [47] than the published chargemaster [48] rates.

          1.1.2.1.2.4. Con:
          The lack of a universal health care is significantly more expensive [49] and puts an even heavier burden on individuals than the taxes that would be used to supply everyone with healthcare.

            1.1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro:
            The combined economic impact of ill-health currently sits at a £77.5 billion a year [50] for the UK economy.

              1.1.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con:
              This is lower than the UK's health care budget, of £145 billion [51].

            1.1.2.1.2.4.2. Pro:
            US government's spending on healthcare outstrips UK government spending [52], both in terms of the proportion of its GDP, and in terms of how much it spends per head.

            1.1.2.1.2.4.3. Con:
            Individuals' poor personal decisions, such as poor dental hygiene and consumption of sugary foods, can outweigh the impact of government-funded healthcare.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Studies and international health organisations agree that healthcare drives economic growth.

        1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
        A US study found that [53] improving public health care funding improved income, GDP, and labor productivity.

        1.1.2.2.2. Pro:
        The world Bank claims that increasing healthcare is beneficial to the economy [54], and is a "foundational investment in economic growth".

        1.1.2.2.3. Pro:
        The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) predicts [55] that a 1.5% increase in healthcare spending would lead to a 2-8% increase in GDP.

        1.1.2.2.4. Con:
        The link between health care and economic growth is complex and multifaceted, and may not always be straightforward.

        1.1.2.2.5. Con:
        While health care may drive economic growth overall, it may not necessarily benefit all segments of society equally, and may exacerbate existing inequalities in access to health care and economic opportunities.

      1.1.2.3. Con:
      An improved economy is not a characteristic of a human right.

        1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
        Human rights are based on fundamental principles of dignity, equality, and freedom that are independent of economic considerations.

        1.1.2.3.2. Con:
        Human rights and a positive economy are directly correlated, implying that a positive economy is not just a characteristic, but a requirement for the existence of human rights.

      1.1.2.4. Pro:
      Healthcare systems that are not universal are inefficient [56], and create loss for an economy.

        1.1.2.4.1. Pro:
        The US, the only developed country without universal healthcare [57], spends more [58] on health care than any other nation with universal health care provision.

          1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
          The ACA [59] has directly lead to vast costs increases [60] across the US [61], with the average cost increase at about 160%.

        1.1.2.4.2. Con:
        Providing universal health care will harm the healthcare industry.

          1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
          Innovation within the healthcare industry is likely to reduce.

            1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro:
            A privately-run company's incentive to make profit incentivizes them to invest into research and development [62]; a public-hospital does not have the same incentive.

            1.1.2.4.2.1.2. Con:
            Most investment into healthcare is publicly funded [63], this is unlikely to change.

          1.1.2.4.2.2. Con:
          A universal healthcare system will allow for better coordination of healthcare services, reducing waste and inefficiency.

            1.1.2.4.2.2.1. Pro:
            A government-run healthcare system can ensure consistent payment [64] to all providers, preventing outlier providers from setting excessive prices due to a client's limited information.

          1.1.2.4.2.3. Con:
          A universal healthcare system simplifies decision-making for the consumer.

            1.1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro:
            In a fragmented insurance system, consumers normally have little visibility [65] on prices across different health insurance plans.

            1.1.2.4.2.3.2. Con:
            Governments have started to require private providers [66] to publish complete price-lists, thereby increasing the access to information for consumers.

          1.1.2.4.2.4. Pro:
          Medical professionals' income is likely to decline within a publicly run healthcare system.

            1.1.2.4.2.4.1. Pro:
            A publicly run healthcare system may prioritize cost control over income growth for medical professionals, leading to reduced income for these professionals.

            1.1.2.4.2.4.2. Pro:
            With a larger pool of patients, medical professionals in a publicly run healthcare system may have to work longer hours or see more patients per day to maintain their income levels.

            1.1.2.4.2.4.3. Con:
            Medical professionals often belong to the highest income bracket [67] in their nation, even when the healthcare system is publicly run.

        1.1.2.4.3. Pro:
        Non-universal healthcare systems often have high administrative costs, as insurance companies and healthcare providers negotiate prices and coverage.

          1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
          Health insurance providers often overcharge [68] customers for administrative charges.

          1.1.2.4.3.2. Pro:
          Not-for-profit hospitals in the U.S have been reported to have a lower admin cost [69] than for-profit private hospitals in the U.S.

          1.1.2.4.3.3. Con:
          Government bureaucracies can also generate excessive administrative costs [70] through inefficient management.

          1.1.2.4.3.4. Con:
          Insurance companies already operate on very thin margins [71], therefore to important that they have negotiating power in order remain competitive.

        1.1.2.4.4. Pro:
        Without a universal healthcare system, patients lack the bargaining power to negotiate lower prices for medical procedures and treatments, which can lead to high costs for both patients and the healthcare system.

          1.1.2.4.4.1. Con:
          Government regulation controlling for exorbitant pricing can exist [72] even in the absence of a universal healthcare system.

          1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro:
          Prescription drugs in the U.S are more expensive than other places due to a lack [73] of single-payer negotiation.

        1.1.2.4.5. Con:
        Government provision of health care is likely to create a very inefficient system.

          1.1.2.4.5.1. Pro:
          State provision or financing of healthcare may facilitate corruption and artificially inflate health insurance costs.

            1.1.2.4.5.1.1. Con:
            Direct healthcare financing makes health insurance optional, which prioritizes protecting the general population's health over increased health insurance costs.

            1.1.2.4.5.1.2. Pro:
            Public healthcare systems are likely to be corrupt.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.2.1. Con:
              Public healthcare [74] can operate without corruption, and there is no proven link between corruption levels [75] and healthcare outcomes across countries.

                1.1.2.4.5.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                Sweden's healthcare [76] is publicly funded, and Sweden is one of the least corrupt countries [77] in the world.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.2.2. Con:
              Private providers can also be corrupt by billing patients or the state fraudulently [78].

              1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3. Pro:
              Government officials, who command significant influence, can embezzle funds [79] for personal gain.

            1.1.2.4.5.1.3. Con:
            US healthcare is the world's most expensive [80], while government-funded systems in Europe offer lower costs and universal access.

            1.1.2.4.5.1.4. Pro:
            Government bureaucracy complicates healthcare and raises costs, while the free market [81] provides better healthcare to more people.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.4.1. Pro:
              Competition [82] in the free market leads to innovation and improved services.

                1.1.2.4.5.1.4.1.1. Pro:
                America's private healthcare industry leads the world [83] in medical research and innovation.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.4.2. Pro:
              The administrative costs of government-run healthcare systems are often much higher than [84] those in the free market.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.4.3. Con:
              In the USA, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, citizens spend more per capita [85] on healthcare than citizens of countries with socialized healthcare.

              1.1.2.4.5.1.4.4. Con:
              Unregulated for-profit healthcare corporations overprice insulin [86], making it unaffordable for those who need it.

          1.1.2.4.5.2. Pro:
          Universal healthcare systems are associated with long waiting-times [87] for patients.

            1.1.2.4.5.2.1. Pro:
            Long waiting times, due to demand exceeding supply, incentivizes bribery to skip lines.

          1.1.2.4.5.3. Con:
          A healthcare system that does not discriminate clients based on their ability to pay is more efficient in improving a country's overall health outcomes.

          1.1.2.4.5.4. Con:
          A private health care sector can also be inefficient due to variances in pricing [88].

        1.1.2.4.6. Con:
        Increasing healthcare availability and reducing costs are important goals, and declaring health care as a human right may not achieve them.

  1.2. Pro:
  Health care is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    Poor health can cause suffering and reduce one's potential in life.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Poor health does not necessarily diminish one's potential in life, and healthcare may not always be essential for a long life

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      Poor health and injuries can affect individuals through no fault of their own.

        1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
        Health care isn't just about lifestyle. Many people end up with astronomical healthcare bills from accidents and injury.

        1.2.1.2.2. Con:
        Poor health and injuries are inherent to living, and not caused by others, thus no one is obliged to provide treatment or remedy.

          1.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
          Poor health and injuries can result from external factors, such as car crashes caused by others or employers' inadequate health and safety measures.

          1.2.1.2.2.2. Con:
          Population-wide diseases, such as STDs [89], are the responsibility of the entire population, thus necessitating collective remedial actions.

          1.2.1.2.2.3. Con:
          Society bears responsibility for repairing the damage caused by natural disasters, and so it should be responsible for providing healthcare for illnesses, whether natural or otherwise.

        1.2.1.2.3. Con:
        ER patients receive treatment [90] regardless of their ability to pay upfront; they are then responsible for paying their debt later.

          1.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
          Lower-income individuals are marginalized and unable to pay for healthcare, which can lead to inability to pay for necessary treatments, resulting in long-term debt.

          1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro:
          Hospitals, in many jurisdictions, are required by law to accept [91] indigent patients and care for them.

          1.2.1.2.3.3. Con:
          ERs are inadequate [92] for addressing the majority of healthcare problems, such as lifelong conditions like diabetes which require continuous management.

        1.2.1.2.4. Pro:
        Poor health may be caused by forces beyond our control such as pollution and environmental [93] stressors.

        1.2.1.2.5. Pro:
        Heart disease, cancer, thyroid disease, and depression are all well-known chronic illnesses [94] that are not the fault of the individual.

          1.2.1.2.5.1. Con:
          Common illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes, can result from personal decisions [95]; treating self-inflicted damage shouldn't be considered a right.

        1.2.1.2.6. Pro:
        Disease is a weakness that we all share. Therefore we should pool our resources and band together.

          1.2.1.2.6.1. Con:
          Human psychology is full of weaknesses that lead to behaviors contrary to our health and well-being. Taking collective action to address the behavioral shortcomings of individuals is problematic, but probably necessary if we accept that premise that instances of weakness demand societal intervention.

          1.2.1.2.6.2. Con:
          Healthier people should not have to pay for the unhealthy choices of those who do not care for themselves. This is taxation of health and subsidy of illness.

          1.2.1.2.6.3. Pro:
          People that are sick do not choose it this way. It's not a privilege to be treated humanely and with respect, and to receive the necessary treatment for ones condition. It's sometimes difficult for healthy people to understand the impact that being sick carries. Sometimes loss of a career, home, friends and unfortunately even family. We should offer our fullest support to these people in our community, and they inreturn should be cared for at the highest possible level.

          1.2.1.2.6.4. Con:
          "Should" does not equal "Must". A goal is not the same as a demand. Even in the Communist Manifesto we have the concept of "ability". That applies to society as well as the individual. As our society becomes wealthier, we may become more generous, but generosity is not an obligation, and we often forget the difference.

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      A healthy body is necessary for productivity and work, making health care a basic precondition to a good and fulfilling life.

        1.2.1.3.1. Con:
        Examples of individuals like Stephen Hawking [96] and Helen Keller [97] demonstrate that one's level of physical ability does not necessarily limit their ability to participate in society.

        1.2.1.3.2. Pro:
        Basic physical health is essential for individual participation in society, regardless of uncontrollable factors such as race and birth circumstances.

      1.2.1.4. Con:
      A fulfilling life requires exercise, healthy eating [98], social connections, and a sense of purpose; it however cannot be said that it is a human right.

    1.2.2. Con:
    Not everything that gives people more fulfilling lives is necessarily a right.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Sex is often necessary [99] for a good and fulfilling life, as well as for the survival of the human race, but it is not considered a human right.

        1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
        Sexual activity is a personal choice and not a fundamental human right.

        1.2.2.1.2. Con:
        Reproductive Rights [100] can be seen as a class of rights that argue for a person's access to sexual wellness for a healthier life.

          1.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
          It is a mischaracterization to suggest that reproductive rights expand to include a 'right to have sex.'

          1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro:
          US Supreme Court recognized reproductive [101] rights, including procreation [102], contraception [103], family relationships [104], and child rearing [105], as fundamental personal rights

          1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro:
          The UN's OHCHR includes reproductive rights [106] as human rights.

        1.2.2.1.3. Con:
        Sex is essential for the survival and growth of the human race.

          1.2.2.1.3.1. Con:
          Whilst sex may be necessary for the survival of the human species, it is not necessary for individual survival.

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      Most things that make a fulfilling life are not necessities, however things that facilitate survival are essential for a fulfilled life.

        1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
        Survival without essential health care would be impossible for many people.

        1.2.2.2.2. Con:
        Under this definition, healthcare would only be a right in the event of curable, fatal diseases.

      1.2.2.3. Pro:
      Health care is not necessary to exercise one's freedoms or pursue their dreams.

    1.2.3. Con:
    Healthcare may be helpful or necessary at times, but its impact on one's ability to lead a fulfilling life can vary.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      Medical interventions can have unintended side effects [107] that affect quality of life.

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      Access to healthcare can prevent or treat illnesses and injuries, which can help people to live longer, healthier lives.

        1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
        Access to healthcare positively impacts [108] a population's average life expectancy.

        1.2.3.2.2. Con:
        A longer, but financially poor, life may be unfulfilling [109].

      1.2.3.3. Pro:
      Health care may extend life, but not everyone acquires value from a long life.

        1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
        Medical interventions may extend life without improving its quality, especially in serious or terminal illnesses [110].

        1.2.3.3.2. Pro:
        Some people prefer to live shorter, but more comfortable, lives.

        1.2.3.3.3. Con:
        Relatively few people choose suicide [111] over medical treatment, for a "comfortable but shorter life" when ill.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    Health of individuals living in a society contributes to the greater good of the community.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      Provision of treatment for people with substance abuse problems has been linked to reduced rates [112] of violent and financially motivated crimes.

      1.2.4.2. Con:
      Paying for the unhealthy or elderly yields no positive benefits for the payer.

        1.2.4.2.1. Con:
        Those people are still benefited later if they end up with health conditions that require a great deal of expensive medical care.

        1.2.4.2.2. Con:
        Healthcare is not only about treatment; it also involves prevention. Everyone can benefit from prevention.

        1.2.4.2.3. Pro:
        Universal healthcare doesn't necessarily lead to a healthier population, as it removes the financial incentive for living a healthy lifestyle.

      1.2.4.3. Con:
      Forcing people to pay for healthcare through the state, via taxes or other means, can have negative consequences for the community.

        1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
        Being forced to fund initiatives that oppose one's morals can decrease government popularity.

          1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          It is immoral to force people to fund things that they are morally opposed to.

          1.2.4.3.1.2. Con:
          Government initiatives funded by taxpayers, although unpopular, follow the democratic process, similar to other taxes.

            1.2.4.3.1.2.1. Pro:
            Taxpayers can vote out their government through the electoral process.

            1.2.4.3.1.2.2. Con:
            The government's popularity also declines when it taxes its population for other unpopular initiatives, such as war.

        1.2.4.3.2. Con:
        Taxes enable governments to fund public goods and services, such as infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs, that benefit society as a whole.

        1.2.4.3.3. Con:
        Taxes help ensure that everyone contributes to society in a fair and equitable way, and that individuals and businesses pay their fair share.

        1.2.4.3.4. Pro:
        Coercive taxes to maintain a health care system inhibits a person's freedom.

        1.2.4.3.5. Pro:
        State-enforced healthcare creates a monopoly, without competition; even if the service is poor, individuals are still required to pay for it, leaving them with little recourse for change.

          1.2.4.3.5.1. Pro:
          A free-market healthcare model allows patients to choose better providers based on price and service, fostering competition and driving growth for quality providers.

          1.2.4.3.5.2. Con:
          Everyone using the same service, including the wealthy, creates a natural incentive to improve the service.

      1.2.4.4. Con:
      A dysfunctional government can pose a significant threat when they have jurisdiction over the availability and accessibility of medical services.

        1.2.4.4.1. Pro:
        A racist government may deny medical treatment based on ethnicity, or could refuse funding for diseases that affect a particular ethnicity.

        1.2.4.4.2. Con:
        A government cannot successfully fund an exclusionary healthcare system since it requires everyone to contribut [113]e in terms of taxes.

      1.2.4.5. Pro:
      Individuals who lack financial resources are not segregated, and their illness can also pose a risk to public health.

      1.2.4.6. Pro:
      Vaccination reduces disease spread [114] and can free up resources for other purposes, promoting prosperity.

        1.2.4.6.1. Con:
        Vaccines do not provide [115] 100% protection against diseases and may not be effective for everyone.

        1.2.4.6.2. Con:
        Vaccines can have side effects [116], and some people may have adverse reactions to them.

        1.2.4.6.3. Con:
        Vaccinating the population is not the same as providing health care to the entire population.

          1.2.4.6.3.1. Con:
          The government's commitment to vaccinating everyone is a fundamental acknowledgement of its responsibility for the overall health of the community.

          1.2.4.6.3.2. Pro:
          The vaccination of any given person may improve the health of wider society [117] by reducing virus spread, most medical procedures do not.

        1.2.4.6.4. Pro:
        Vaccines are incredibly cost efficient [118], and likely even profitable for the taxpayer.

          1.2.4.6.4.1. Pro:
          The costs of insurance companies and benefit managers are minimized due to the decreased risk of individuals contracting deadly diseases.

          1.2.4.6.4.2. Con:
          Manufacturing vaccines can be incredibly expensive [119], which can result in a high end price of vaccines.

        1.2.4.6.5. Pro:
        Maximizing population health benefits everyone by reducing costs from lost work, homelessness, and contagion.

        1.2.4.6.6. Pro:
        Increased rates vaccination can achieve herd immunity [120] within a population, leading to a healthier society.

          1.2.4.6.6.1. Pro:
          Herd immunity can also prevent the emergence of new strains of infectious diseases by reducing the number of hosts available [121] for the disease to infect and mutate within.

          1.2.4.6.6.2. Con:
          Herd immunity contradicts the concept of human rights since it obligates individuals to get vaccinated, which is contrary to the freedom that is inherent in human rights.

  1.3. Con:
  Health care does not fit within the confines of what defines a human right.

    1.3.1. Pro:
    Health care cannot be termed as an inalienable, and inherent right.

      1.3.1.1. Pro:
      An inherent right [122] is innate and exists naturally, independent of laws or society, and healthcare does not fit this definition.

        1.3.1.1.1. Con:
        Rights are determined by society, and individuals are not born with inherent rights.

          1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          There are no inherent human rights at the philosophical level, as all rights are defined and granted by humans, including different definitions chosen by various groups, cultures, and nations.

          1.3.1.1.1.2. Con:
          Although one's place of birth and the actions of others can impact the degree to which their rights are respected, everyone possesses inherent and inalienable [123] human rights.

            1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
            Human rights are universal and indivisible, meaning that they cannot be separated or denied to some individuals without undermining the rights of all.

            1.3.1.1.1.2.2. Con:
            There is no such thing as a natural right. The very theory of natural rights is self-evidently the philosophical work of humans.

          1.3.1.1.1.3. Con:
          A right can only be a natural right, best described as self-evident in the U.S. Declaration of Independence [124]: "They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable right."

        1.3.1.1.2. Pro:
        Education, similar to health care, is beneficial, but is not an inherent human right that exists in nature.

        1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
        Rights are inherent to a person and not something to be provided at another's expense.

          1.3.1.1.3.1. Con:
          The idea that rights cannot be provided at another's expense can be seen as overly individualistic and neglectful of the broader societal benefits that can come from ensuring that everyone's rights are fulfilled.

          1.3.1.1.3.2. Con:
          Medical conditions can interfere with a person’s ability to access all other human rights. If the poor are denied healthcare for lack of money, they are being denied other human rights for lack of money. That goes against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

          1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro:
          Forcing someone to provide healthcare denies their right to liberty since they cannot refuse to serve.

      1.3.1.2. Con:
      Health care, while not an inherent right, but can be considered an economic, social, and cultural right, or a positive right. [125]

        1.3.1.2.1. Con:
        The U.S. Constitution does not provide for "Positive Rights" [126] such as the right to health care.

          1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          Supreme court rulings support this view, that the Constitution is a charter of negative rather than positive liberties [127].

          1.3.1.2.1.2. Con:
          If human rights are only considered valid as formal legal rights, it undermines the universality of these principles due to the contingent historical and political nature [128] of legal norms.

            1.3.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            A legal document, such as a constitution, is based upon universal principles; declaring health care to be a human right would simply result in an amendment to the constitution.

            1.3.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
            If a right isn't codified as formal legal right, there is no use-value [129] to the right.

        1.3.1.2.2. Con:
        The UN argues that [130] the enjoyment of all human rights is interlinked so categories of rights such as “civil and political rights” or “economic, social and cultural rights” make little sense.

          1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          The Universal Declaration of Human Rights no longer [131] makes any distinction between civil rights and economic, social, and cultural rights.

          1.3.1.2.2.2. Con:
          Health care, as a human right, can be argued to be similarly interlinked to other fundamental human rights, such as the right to life.

        1.3.1.2.3. Pro:
        Justice, Equality, and Freedom of speech are beneficial for humanity even while not echoed in nature.

          1.3.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          Access to justice is considered to be a human right [132], while not necessarily grounded in nature.

          1.3.1.2.3.2. Pro:
          All humans are considered to be equal, even though they might not be equal at birth [133].

          1.3.1.2.3.3. Con:
          Equality among humans is echoed in nature, hierarchy is a social construct.

          1.3.1.2.3.4. Con:
          Justice is a product of the supposed natural right to self defense [134] and the right to property [135].

          1.3.1.2.3.5. Con:
          Freedom of speech is a derivative of the supposed natural right to freewill [136].

        1.3.1.2.4. Pro:
        Access to health care is a fundamental necessity for leading a productive life, both financially and otherwise, and is therefore important principle to aspire towards.

      1.3.1.3. Pro:
      Health care is a finite resource, and therefore cannot be inherent to each person.

        1.3.1.3.1. Con:
        "Human right" doesn't mean equal application. It just means guaranteed opportunity for.

          1.3.1.3.1.1. Con:
          This suggests that there isn't a right to health care, merely a right to pursue health care.

          1.3.1.3.1.2. Pro:
          It does not make sense to try and provide health care to every person equally, as circumstances differ between people.

        1.3.1.3.2. Pro:
        Medical inputs necessary for a person's treatment are often limited in supply.

          1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          Fiercely contested components (e.g. organ donations) should be offered in terms of clinical suitability and likelihood of improvement, not equally.

            1.3.1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            Restrictive regulations pertaining to organ donation that maximize health outcomes, are controversial because they treat people as means to an end without taking personal views into consideration.

            1.3.1.3.2.1.2. Con:
            Allocating finite resources to have the most positive impact reflects the belief that improving the overall population's health is a priority, similar to the belief that all individuals deserve equal access to health improvements.

          1.3.1.3.2.2. Con:
          Advances in medical technology and research are constantly expanding the range of available medical treatments and inputs.

          1.3.1.3.2.3. Con:
          Government investments in healthcare infrastructure and research can increase the availability of medical inputs over time.

          1.3.1.3.2.4. Pro:
          Rights cannot guarantee access to things that cannot be guaranteed to exist. For instance, a person can have a right to life but not to a life-sustaining medicine, as medicines may sometimes be inaccessible.

        1.3.1.3.3. Con:
        Various resources, while being finite, are considered to be human rights.

          1.3.1.3.3.1. Pro:
          Water, a finite resource, is defined by the UN [137] as a human right.

            1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
            In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly recognized [138] access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right.

            1.3.1.3.3.1.2. Pro:
            Clean and safe water is essential for human survival and health as it enables basic hygiene and necessary daily tasks, reducing the risk of illness and disease.

            1.3.1.3.3.1.3. Con:
            Health care does not occur naturally. If water comes through a pipe or in a bottle you still pay for it.

              1.3.1.3.3.1.3.1. Con:
              Water is a human right whether it is found naturally, paid for by the bottle [139], or delivered by pipe.

              1.3.1.3.3.1.3.2. Pro:
              Many countries, such as the US, do not [140] recognize water as a human right, while acknowledging that it may be essential.

            1.3.1.3.3.1.4. Con:
            It is a lot easier to provide someone with clean water than with quality health care, so this is not a good comparison.

          1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro:
          Food and shelter are finite resources, but generally accepted as basic human rights.

            1.3.1.3.3.2.1. Con:
            Food and shelter is both essential to life and not provided by government, and yet almost nobody freezes or starves to death in the western world simply for want of food [141] or shelter [142].

            1.3.1.3.3.2.2. Pro:
            In the USA, almost 16 million [143] children lived in food-insecure households in 2012. Childhood hunger causes an "increase in both physical and psychological health problems [144]".

          1.3.1.3.3.3. Con:
          Health care is unique because it is much more expensive than any other necessary good like food or water. It is also not readily available from nature.

            1.3.1.3.3.3.1. Con:
            Cost should not decide what is a right, but only cause a limit to the extent a right can be upheld.

          1.3.1.3.3.4. Con:
          This claim proves the underlying lack of feasibility of proscribing positive rights to a good or service. Availability absolutely dictates access: if it's not there you can't have it.

        1.3.1.3.4. Pro:
        There is an insufficient number [145] of health care professionals [146] working an insufficient number of man-hours to provide the level of care desired by universal healthcare advocates.

          1.3.1.3.4.1. Con:
          Health care systems do not suffer from a lack of physicians, but from an uneven distribution [147] of physicians.

      1.3.1.4. Con:
      There is an international consensus that health care is a human right.

        1.3.1.4.1. Pro:
        The International Bill of Human Rights [148] includes health care as a human right [149].

          1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro:
          The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also declares [150] health care as an essential right, that must be accessible to all.

            1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is legally binding [151] when ratified.

            1.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con:
            Twenty four countries and four non-UN members [152] have not ratified the treaty.

              1.3.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              The USA, a major world power, has not ratified [153] the treaty.

                1.3.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.

                1.3.1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                A lack of ratification by a major power, for whatever reason, signals certain principles, otherwise considered paramount, to be contestable.

              1.3.1.4.1.1.2.2. Con:
              The USA recognizes parts of some non-ratified treaties as customary international law [154] and binding upon them as such [155].

          1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro:
          In 1948, the UN adopted the Universal Human Rights Declaration. Article 25 [156] (p. 52) states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services."

            1.3.1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
            Access to health care has been recognized as a right, as codified by The Geneva Conventions [157], even in times of war.

            1.3.1.4.1.2.2. Con:
            Medical care is different from health care; treatment for a life-threatening affliction is not the same as annual check-ups.

              1.3.1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro:
              Health care is complicated and made up of several sub-parts. For example, accessibility to nutritional advice could be considered part of health care.

              1.3.1.4.1.2.2.2. Con:
              Healthcare is sometimes defined as [158] "the organized provision of medical care to individuals or a community". This suggests there is little difference between the terms, as health care just refers to the provision of medical care.

          1.3.1.4.1.3. Con:
          Rights are determined by society and subject to what is feasible. If something cannot be provided, it cannot be considered a right in that society.

            1.3.1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
            The right to healthcare is not to any specific form of healthcare but to what is available [159].

            1.3.1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
            Governments distribute hospitals geographically and provide emergency services for transportation to hospitals, but to expect all these services to be provided for free is unfair.

            1.3.1.4.1.3.3. Con:
            Lack of food availability does not nullify the right to food, just as depletion of medical resources does not negate the right to treatment. Both are essential for survival and wellbeing, and should be replenished when possible.

        1.3.1.4.2. Con:
        A right is what is owed or allowed to people by their society. Nothing can be a right in general, but only within a particular context or society.

          1.3.1.4.2.1. Con:
          Rights are inherent to human beings and not dependent on geography, culture, or time. Variations in rights across societies would imply a variable value of human life, which is discriminatory.

            1.3.1.4.2.1.1. Con:
            Different societies and cultures have different values and beliefs, which can lead to different interpretations of what rights are and what they entail.

            1.3.1.4.2.1.2. Pro:
            The right to access professional healthcare in times of need has the same foundation as the right to not be killed, starved, or deprived of basic necessities, as both are universally desired by humans.

          1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro:
          Human rights don't exist, but only particular and providable rights in each society - i.e., in a society where healthcare is providable, it will be a right.

            1.3.1.4.2.2.1. Pro:
            There are no globally applicable human rights.

            1.3.1.4.2.2.2. Con:
            Just because healthcare is not possible to provide, doesn't mean it's not a human right; human rights are violated all the time, but that doesn't make them any less human rights.

              1.3.1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro:
              Countries being invaded cannot provide the human right to life to their citizens anymore, but this is not a valid reason to consider the human right to life invalid.

            1.3.1.4.2.2.3. Pro:
            Healthcare lacks a universal standard for defining what is adequate, which can vary across cultures and time periods.

            1.3.1.4.2.2.4. Con:
            Human rights are often defined as inalienable, fundamental rights inherent to all human beings "regardless of their nation [160]". Therefore, the overarching principle cannot be bound by location or type of society.

    1.3.2. Con:
    You don't have a right to another's labor.

      1.3.2.1. Con:
      Several other human rights rely on the labor of others, and the resources of the state, to be upheld.

        1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
        The right to food [161], and the right to housing [162], are internationally defined and accepted [163], but require labor, money, and effort.

          1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Most people, all over the world, are required to pay for food and housing; arguments for universal healthcare suggest that it should be free for all citizens.

          1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
          The right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it, or a right to be fed. This is not a human right in the same way that health care is suggested to become a human right.

            1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
            The ICESCR [164] says "the right to adequate food is realised when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, have the physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement."

        1.3.2.1.2. Con:
        These rights are different, they are positive not negative [165], and are economic, social, and cultural. [166]

          1.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
          Three generations of human rights [167] includes these rights as human rights (second and third generations).

          1.3.2.1.2.2. Con:
          -> See 1.3.1.2.2.

          1.3.2.1.2.3. Pro:
          Economic, social and cultural rights [168] are not always considered full human rights.

            1.3.2.1.2.3.1. Pro:
            While there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights [169] such as the right to a fair trial, free speech, or a right to education, there is disagreement [170] about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights.

        1.3.2.1.3. Con:
        These also shouldn't be considered rights. Rights should not impose any obligation on others, they should only require non-interference.

        1.3.2.1.4. Pro:
        The right to vote requires the state to offer every voter suitable means and locations to vote, including election officials and judges.

          1.3.2.1.4.1. Con:
          Voting, in most jurisdictions, is optional [171].

          1.3.2.1.4.2. Con:
          Not all [172] nations hold elections.

          1.3.2.1.4.3. Pro:
          Most states have to appoint thousands of poll clerks [173] across the district in order to hold an election.

        1.3.2.1.5. Pro:
        The state provides citizens with free counsel [174] in order to uphold their right to a fair trial.

          1.3.2.1.5.1. Pro:
          Free legal counsel ensures equal access to legal representation, necessary for a fair trial, particularly for those who cannot afford it.

          1.3.2.1.5.2. Con:
          The right to representation [175] is triggered only when the state charges you in criminal court, therefore it exists with constraints unlike publicly provisioned health care.

            1.3.2.1.5.2.1. Con:
            Access to health care by a public practitioner can also be placed within reasonable constraints.

        1.3.2.1.6. Con:
        The state's allocation of resources to specific initiatives cannot be used as a proxy to determine whether something is a human right.

        1.3.2.1.7. Pro:
        The right to education [176] is a similar human right which is accepted and functioning. It is similar in that it requires a functioning economy, trained paid professionals, and has a private alternative.

          1.3.2.1.7.1. Con:
          Education is limited by age and level, while healthcare cannot be similarly limited.

            1.3.2.1.7.1.1. Con:
            Healthcare can also be limited for elective procedures [177] and/or limited to crucial non-elective procedures [178].

            1.3.2.1.7.1.2. Pro:
            Most states do not provide free-education beyond secondary school.

            1.3.2.1.7.1.3. Con:
            Human rights have limitations. For example, the right to life can be limited in cases of self-defense, and the right to freedom of speech can be limited in cases of hate speech or breaching legally binding agreements.

          1.3.2.1.7.2. Pro:
          The UN Right To Education [179] has been agreed by 166 states, and has been in effect since 1976.

          1.3.2.1.7.3. Con:
          Healthcare costs more than Education.

            1.3.2.1.7.3.1. Con:
            -> See 1.3.1.3.3.3.1.

            1.3.2.1.7.3.2. Pro:
            In the UK, Healthcare costs [180] £149.7 billion (19%), but Education only costs £85.3 billion (11%).
            (USA [181]:  22% / 15%).

          1.3.2.1.7.4. Pro:
          The most international definition of a human right is that of the UN, which includes Education in it's 1948 Universal declaration of Human Rights [182]

      1.3.2.2. Pro:
      No individual may compel another individual to provide a service to them; universal health care depends on the state compelling healthcare professionals to provide their service.

        1.3.2.2.1. Con:
        Doctors can opt to work in the private sector, as opposed to, working for the state.

        1.3.2.2.2. Con:
        Many governments require their citizens to perform mandatory labor in specific circumstances for the benefit of society.

          1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          Citizens in many jurisdictions are required to perform mandatory jury service [183].

          1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro:
          During times of war, governments have been known to impose mandatory military conscription [184].

          1.3.2.2.2.3. Con:
          Mandatory labor can perpetuate systems of inequality and injustice, particularly if certain groups are disproportionately targeted or affected.

          1.3.2.2.2.4. Con:
          Mandatory labor is a form of exploitation and violates individuals' rights to freedom and autonomy.

          1.3.2.2.2.5. Pro:
          Citizens demand and expect the services of the police, and the state obliges, in times of insecurity.

        1.3.2.2.3. Pro:
        Being fairly compensated for the provision of your labor is a human right, and it conflicts with the declaration of health care as a right.

          1.3.2.2.3.1. Con:
          Health care professional working in the public sector are fairly compensated [185] for their labor.

          1.3.2.2.3.2. Con:
          Citizens have the free choice to not enter [186] a paid-contractual relationship with the state as their employer.

          1.3.2.2.3.3. Pro:
          In cases of emergencies, doctors are often required to provide their services without an assurance of payment.

          1.3.2.2.3.4. Pro:
          The right to freely render (or not render) services is a consistent based on a set of rights that are not adorned by government, but understood to be universal.

          1.3.2.2.3.5. Con:
          Many accepted Human rights have conflicts [187] between them.  In a developed nation, the Procedural Right to getting paid could co-exist with the Substantive [188] right to healthcare.

  1.4. Pro:
  Providing healthcare as a human right ensures citizens' access to life and obligates the state to provide it to all.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    Universal healthcare, as provided by the state, protects everyone's right to life.

      1.4.1.1. Con:
      Universal healthcare, as a human right, is counterproductive if it cannot be fully provided by the government.

        1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
        Treating universal healthcare as a human right enables citizens to sue the government for violating it, which is costly and ineffective if the government cannot provide such healthcare practically.

        1.4.1.1.2. Con:
        Many countries [189], both rich and poor, already provide universal healthcare, demonstrating that it is an achievable standard to require and not an impossible one.

        1.4.1.1.3. Pro:
        Although the right to life is a human right, the right to health is not. Therefore, the state should only provide the minimum necessary to sustain a person's life and not go beyond that.

        1.4.1.1.4. Pro:
        Universal healthcare does not provide equal access; long wait times for treatment are common, as seen in Canada [190], and Britain [191].

          1.4.1.1.4.1. Con:
          Private healthcare is an option in countries with public healthcare systems for those who prefer not to wait.

      1.4.1.2. Con:
      Universal healthcare is not feasible.

        1.4.1.2.1. Con:
        A universal healthcare system can exist in numerous forms [192].

          1.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
          Universal health care, in any form, necessitates substantial government spending, which is typically financed through increased taxation.

          1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          There exist mixed systems, such as in Germany [193]. Monetary interest persists, yet everyone obtains health care regardless of the income.

          1.4.1.2.1.3. Pro:
          A quality public healthcare service benefits both those who can afford private treatment and those who cannot, especially in less developed countries with limited access to affordable care.

        1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
        Emergency life-sustaining treatment may be feasible, but a broad definition that encompasses all things improving well-being would be impractical.

          1.4.1.2.2.1. Con:
          Many countries [194] already do provide healthcare that improves wellbeing rather than just emergency treatment.

        1.4.1.2.3. Pro:
        It is difficult to quantify the extent to which health care is a right, which makes the idea of universal health care impractical.

          1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          Defining a universal right to health care is challenging due to varying societal standards for adequate care and no consensus on essential health care services.

          1.4.1.2.3.2. Con:
          Many other human rights have semi-vague quantifications, and still function well. The specifics can be left to each government.

            1.4.1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
            The human right to education is only required to be [195] "made generally available", and higher education has to be "equally accessible to all on the basis of merit". Education is a well functioning human right despite the minimum/maximum quantity being unspecified.

            1.4.1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
            The right to work has no specific qualifications [196] like hours worked or pay, it merely specifies "free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment." and protects from discrimination.

            1.4.1.2.3.2.3. Con:
            A right cannot be vague or it is meaningless.

            1.4.1.2.3.2.4. Con:
            This argument is fallacious as it is predicated on other human rights being accepted as human rights.

          1.4.1.2.3.3. Con:
          Low quality healthcare is better than none.

            1.4.1.2.3.3.1. Con:
            Low quality medical interventions can be dangerous [197] for the patient.

            1.4.1.2.3.3.2. Pro:
            Access to some healthcare services, even if they are low quality, can be crucial in emergency situations or in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

        1.4.1.2.4. Con:
        Advancements in technology and medicine makes it feasible to provide health care to all.

          1.4.1.2.4.1. Pro:
          Technological advancements have paved the pay for newer and cheaper modes of health delivery, such as telehealth [198].

          1.4.1.2.4.2. Con:
          The advanced technology has only served to increase the cost, not lessen it.

            1.4.1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
            The cost of heath care per capita has been steadily increasing [199].

            1.4.1.2.4.2.2. Con:
            A good deal of modern medical costs for the hospitals is administration [200] needed to handle payments from virtually limitless insurance companies.

        1.4.1.2.5. Con:
        The World Health organisation (WHO) has released a report [201] which maps the ways that all countries can sustainably achieve universal healthcare.

          1.4.1.2.5.1. Pro:
          The 49 "low-income countries" that would find it hardest to adopt universal healthcare have been given a roadmap [202] which includes Increasing the efficiency of revenue collection, reprioritising government budgets, innovating financing, and receiving development assistance for health supported by the Millennium Development Goals.

          1.4.1.2.5.2. Pro:
          This report estimates that from 20% to 40% of all health spending is currently wasted through inefficiency [203], and urges these savings to be pursued instead of cutting funding or leaving some citizens with no care at all.

          1.4.1.2.5.3. Con:
          This report's recommendations for sustainability are as follows: 1) Increase the efficiency of revenue collection 2) Reprioritize government budgets 3) Innovative financing 4) Development assistance for health. In short: raise taxes, spend more on healthcare, raise more money, and get money from other nations. Hardly "innovative".

        1.4.1.2.6. Pro:
        Universal healthcare requires everyone to contribute to the system, which some consider unfair because it makes the sick pay for the sick.

          1.4.1.2.6.1. Con:
          This assumes that the sick (or the poor, in your analogy) are not at fault for their condition. That is not always the case.

      1.4.1.3. Pro:
      Universal healthcare [204] can reduce the spread of communicable diseases.

        1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
        Free medical assistance has been essential in tackling outbreaks, such as Ebola [205].

        1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
        Uncontrolled spread of viruses and bacteria provides a breeding ground for them to evolve [206] and become more virulent.

        1.4.1.3.3. Con:
        Many policies, such as lock-downs, can also reduce the spread [207] of communicable diseases.

      1.4.1.4. Pro:
      For those suffering from disease, health care is necessary to ensure survival.

        1.4.1.4.1. Con:
        If disease has been contracted due to personal negligence, it is unfair for the government to fund recovery at the cost of potentially beneficial programs for those citizens who led healthier lives.

        1.4.1.4.2. Pro:
        Those on round-the-clock life support [208] need health care to continue living.

      1.4.1.5. Con:
      Universally available preventive health care, as opposed to complete universal health care, can effectively fulfill a state's duty to protect a person's right to life.

        1.4.1.5.1. Pro:
        The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that preventative interventions are cost-effective in both the shorter and longer term [209].

        1.4.1.5.2. Pro:
        Every dollar spent on preventing obesity has a six-fold return [210] on investment.

        1.4.1.5.3. Con:
        Even with preventative care, some conditions may go undetected or be misdiagnosed [211] until it is too late for effective treatment.

        1.4.1.5.4. Con:
        Preventative care requires regular checkups and monitoring, which may not be accessible in a world without complete universal health care.

    1.4.2. Con:
    Health care as a a human right impacts the people's ability to access other fundamental rights such as the right to freedom and liberty.

      1.4.2.1. Con:
      A lack of health care coerces people into making choices that compromise their freedom and liberty.

        1.4.2.1.1. Pro:
        Poorer citizens may be forced to take up debt in order to pay for excessive medical bills.

          1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          About 100 million [212] people in the U.S are reported to have healthcare debt.

          1.4.2.1.1.2. Con:
          People can access debt settlement programs [213] in order to get out of debt.

        1.4.2.1.2. Con:
        Universal health care by default limits a person's financial freedom, since they cannot opt out of the program and spend their tax contribution elsewhere.

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      Excessive government spending on healthcare may limit other government services and impede individual liberty through high taxation.

      1.4.2.3. Con:
      Human rights are inherent and cannot be revoked because they might "impact other people".

      1.4.2.4. Pro:
      Life is a right, but individuals are responsible for taking care of it, obligating other to do so violates their freedom.

        1.4.2.4.1. Con:
        If societies understand health as a human right it creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality [214].

        1.4.2.4.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.

    1.4.3. Con:
    It is not necessary for the state to provide health care as people can access it themselves.

      1.4.3.1. Con:
      It is the duty of the state to protect vulnerable citizens.

        1.4.3.1.1. Con:
        The state can provide healthcare only to vulnerable citizens without declaring it a human right across the board.

          1.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
          Lack of healthcare can lead to needless suffering for everyone, and the state has a duty to protect all citizens.

          1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          SCHIP [215] extends medical coverage to vulnerable youth in the US not covered by regular MEDICAID.

          1.4.3.1.1.3. Con:
          We need human rights for protection when our legal rights are violated by the state, and to encourage justice and fairness within our societies. Making healthcare a human right would mean that citizens have the ability to challenge their state, if that state fails to fulfil their rights.

          1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro:
          MEDICAID [216], in the US, provides healthcare only to the most vulnerable US citizens.

        1.4.3.1.2. Pro:
        Denying healthcare to the poor is ethically wrong.

          1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro:
          Denying healthcare to the poor is a violation of the principle of justice [217], which requires that resources and benefits should be distributed fairly.

          1.4.3.1.2.2. Con:
          Money is not as consequential to the absence of suffering as medical and technological advancements are. Rich people of the past had less access to effective care than poor people today do.

            1.4.3.1.2.2.1. Con:
            More money can fund the further expansion of necessary medical and technological advancements.

            1.4.3.1.2.2.2. Pro:
            Consequently, yesterday's rich are the early adopters that make today's care more accessible and higher quality.

          1.4.3.1.2.3. Con:
          Resources are limited. It is impossible to provide a standard of care for everyone that is equivalent to what wealthy people can afford.

          1.4.3.1.2.4. Pro:
          Governments have a duty to provide healthcare to citizens to ensure their right to life, as medical expenses can be a significant burden [218] for many households, especially the poor.

          1.4.3.1.2.5. Pro:
          Over one billion people worldwide cannot afford healthcare [219], and seeking medical help pushes almost 100 million people into poverty.

          1.4.3.1.2.6. Con:
          Low wages and the absence of employer health insurance programs have led to the poor's inability to access healthcare, not a lack of government provision.

          1.4.3.1.2.7. Pro:
          If healthcare is prohibitively expensive to the average citizen, then it becomes the duty of the state to provide it.

        1.4.3.1.3. Pro:
        Denying the right to health care disproportionately discriminates against aged, sick, disabled, and poor citizens.

          1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro:
          These groups are less likely to be able to work and more likely to require health care. It is unreasonable to say that because they cannot afford it the state should not look after them.

          1.4.3.1.3.2. Con:
          State has a duty to protect citizens, but open-ended healthcare commitment may burden future citizens paying for an aging population's care.

          1.4.3.1.3.3. Con:
          Just because an action causes more harm to one group than another doesn't make it discriminatory.​ [220]

      1.4.3.2. Pro:
      Health care can be made available without government provision, as businesses can provide it through markets.

        1.4.3.2.1. Pro:
        Since the state upholds every citizen's right to liberty, individuals are responsible for earning an income and can choose to use it for healthcare expenses.

        1.4.3.2.2. Con:
        Corporations are incentivized by profits [221], and as such, they have no obligation to provide healthcare free of charge.

        1.4.3.2.3. Con:
        When healthcare is provided by the private sector, it can still be a human right, it would just be enforced by government regulations.

"The first and largest group that sees the chargemaster rates is health insurance companies as they negotiate what they are willing to pay for each item. These negotiations occur every year or every other year."
[48] https://blog.eoscu.com/blog/what-is-the-chargemaster
"In healthcare, the price list is called the chargemaster, or charge description master and it is considered the "central mechanism of the revenue cycle." This massive list of every billable medication, procedure, service, fee, room charge, supply, or evaluation can run up to 50,000 items, and each item has associated codes for billing and tracking purposes."

"Until now, consumers had no way to know before they got the bill what prices they and their insurers would be paying. Some insurance companies have refused to provide the information when asked by patients and the employers that hired the companies to provide coverage.

This secrecy has allowed hospitals to tell patients that they are getting “steep” discounts, while still charging them many times what a public program like Medicare is willing to pay."

"In countries where there is single-payer healthcare — in other words where the government pays for most healthcare costs — those governments have significant negotiating power with drug companies to lower prices. 

In the U.S., however, various private insurers and smaller government programs negotiate prices with drugmakers individually. This in turn lowers their bargaining power."

"By "property," Locke meant more than land and goods that could be sold, given away, or even confiscated by the government under certain circumstances. Property also referred to ownership of one's self, which included a right to personal well being. Jefferson, however, substituted the phrase, "pursuit of happiness," which Locke and others had used to describe freedom of opportunity as well as the duty to help those in want.

The purpose of government, Locke wrote, is to secure and protect the God-given inalienable natural rights of the people. For their part, the people must obey the laws of their rulers."

"Physicians prefer to work in the public sector, though the value of working in the public sector is very small at 0.14% of their annual earnings to work an additional hour per week. These preferences are heterogeneous. Contrary to other studies that show risk averse individuals prefer public sector work, for physicians, we find that those averse to taking career or clinical risks prefer to work in the private sector."
