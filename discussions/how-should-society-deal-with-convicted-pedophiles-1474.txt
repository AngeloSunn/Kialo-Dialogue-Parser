How should society deal with convicted pedophiles?

1. Question:
How should society deal with pedophiles [1] convicted of child sex offences?

  1.1. Thesis:
  Pedophiles should be treated by medical professionals, with their release conditional on treatment objectives and sentencing requirements.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Such treatments may not work in all cases. Where they fail, untreated sex offenders could do further harm to society with little to stop them.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      Without special requirements after treatment, there would be nothing to prevent those convicted of child sex crimes from working with children and former victims in the future.

        1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
        Pedophiles who haven't undergone serious reform who have children could cause trauma [2] to the next generation.

        1.1.1.1.2. Con:
        States could still have laws [3] that prohibit or allow discrimination against criminals working in certain professions even after treatment. Such laws are already common.

        1.1.1.1.3. Pro:
        Even a random encounter with their abuser on the street can cause significant emotional damage [4] to victims.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Treating pedophilia as a mental illness [5] would destigmatize pedophiles and encourage them to seek help before they commit crimes.

        1.1.1.2.1. Con:
        Released pedophiles who still lack an understanding of the harm [6] they have created are likely to re-offend. As such, the 'mental illness' approach is far riskier than more punitive alternatives.

        1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
        Germany [7] seeks to treat pedophiles before they offend, to reduce the overall likelihood of these crimes being committed.

          1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          Early indications suggest these policies have been successful [8].

          1.1.1.2.2.2. Con:
          Many have noted that this experiment has produced insufficient data [9] to call it a success.

        1.1.1.2.3. Pro:
        Psychiatrists have been able to treat pedophiles and help them control their desires [10] without reporting them to the authorities.

    1.1.2. Con:
    Sex offender rehabilitation programs often do not work.

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      Sex offender rehabilitation programs often do not work and may actually increase the risk [11] of reoffending.

        1.1.2.1.1. Con:
        A lack of empathy and compassion can often trigger re-offending [12]. Cultivating compassion in convicts could help reduce future risk.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        Many of these studies were conducted in prisons, which are sub-optimal locations for rehabilitation [13].

        1.1.2.1.3. Pro:
        One UK experiment drew controversy for effectively allowing prisoners to be released from prisons [14] without changing their behavior, putting people at risk.

        1.1.2.1.4. Pro:
        Such group programs can serve to normalize the desires and crimes, making offenders even more likely to act once they are released from prison (p. 27 [15]).

      1.1.2.2. Con:
      It is typically older forms of rehabilitation, like attempts at victim empathy [16], that fail to work. There exist alternatives to this.

        1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
        Research [17] tends to show that group therapy is not as effective as individual therapy. As such, these failures are not indicative of a general inability to rehabilitate sex offenders.

        1.1.2.2.2. Pro:
        More supportive [18] forms of rehabilitation tend to work better.

        1.1.2.2.3. Con:
        Other, community-based, efforts at rehabilitation often face significant problems [19]due to the level of investment they require and the lack of political pressure sustaining them.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    Pedophiles should be chemically castrated [20] to reduce their sexual desires.

      1.1.3.1. Con:
      Chemical castration has several harmful side effects.

        1.1.3.1.1. Pro:
        Medical techniques to eliminate sexual desires generally work by lowering testosterone levels [21], which is linked to several health complications in men.

          1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          Several [22] studies have shown that lowered testosterone levels in men can cause mental health problems [23], low bone density, hot flashes and erectile dysfunction.

          1.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
          All medications have side effects. Diminishing one's testosterone levels is a treatment that happens frequently [24], demonstrating that it is not an especially dangerous treatment.

        1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
        Effective dosages can vary widely [25], increasing the risk of such side effects.

        1.1.3.1.3. Pro:
        The side effects [26] of chemical castration can include increased rates of migraines, gallstones, blood clots, allergic reactions, and suicidal thoughts and actions.

          1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro:
          Alan Turing [27] - the World War II codebreaker - committed suicide after chemical castration treatment.

        1.1.3.1.4. Con:
        Despite the side effects of chemical castration, trial patients admitted that it felt better [28] than feeling unwanted urges.

          1.1.3.1.4.1. Con:
          As these individuals are often under extreme duress - often choosing between castration or further incarceration - their requests should not be considered free or authentic (p. 6, 18 [29]).

        1.1.3.1.5. Con:
        The potential side effects of chemical castration are much less severe than the potential risks of other forms of punishment, like imprisonment.

          1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro:
          Research has repeatedly demonstrated that imprisonment causes horrific damage [30] to the mental health of inmates.

          1.1.3.1.5.2. Pro:
          Prisoners often face a variety of physical health problems [31] often owing to the conditions of prisons.

          1.1.3.1.5.3. Con:
          Prisons can be reformed and inmates can receive help after they are released. Chemical castration, however, is a life-long process whose side effects will last lifetimes.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      Chemical castration addresses the root causes of sexual assault and would decrease rates of sexual deviance.

        1.1.3.2.1. Con:
        Chemical castration would not affect the environmental issues that often cause these crimes.

          1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
          Chemical castration may make future abuse more likely, by making former convicts feel disempowered and emasculated [32], and therefore more motivated to exert power and control over others.

          1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
          Sexual desire depends not only on physical attributes, but also on psychology [33], meaning chemical castration would not eliminate the whole problem.

          1.1.3.2.1.3. Con:
          While chemical castration does not entirely mitigate motives for sexual assault, it does significantly reduce the ability of male offenders to get and maintain an erection (p. 16 [34]), rendering them incapable of many types of assault.

          1.1.3.2.1.4. Con:
          Chemical castration eliminates the main reasons that cause other motives to manifest as child sexual abuse: sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for sexual arousal (p. 2 [35]).

        1.1.3.2.2. Pro:
        The use of chemical castration decreases recidivism rates by between 2-5% compared with the expected rate of 50% in cases where it is not used (p. 171 [36]).

          1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
          A trial of Lupron to lower testosterone [37] found that it reduced sex drive and mitigated deviant desires, even in seemingly incurable, reoffending, and sadistic pedophiles.

        1.1.3.2.3. Con:
        Chemical castration only works if the individual continues to regularly [38] take their medication. If the medication is abandoned, they will be just as likely to abuse again.

          1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro:
          The state has no reliable method by which they can guarantee someone living independently, outside of state institutions, will continue to take their mandatory pills.

          1.1.3.2.3.2. Con:
          Parole visits could be used to monitor and supervise [39] ex-convicts regarding their consumption of castration pills and their actions.

            1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Con:
            Parole officers are often overburdened [40] and, therefore, are often unable to prevent recidivism.

          1.1.3.2.3.3. Con:
          Regular doses could be given in supervised clinics or through community outreach [41] to ensure convicted pedophiles are unable to withdraw from treatment.

        1.1.3.2.4. Pro:
        Removing the sex drive of sex offenders will make it easier and safer to release them into the community, allowing them to take jobs and contribute to society.

          1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro:
          Drugs [42] designed to disrupt testosterone levels can help pedophiles improve control over their urges and reduce their aggressive tendencies [43].

          1.1.3.2.4.2. Con:
          The use of chemical castration may reduce the urgency of authorities [44] to continue policing past sex offenders, if they assume these offenders no longer have criminal desires.

        1.1.3.2.5. Con:
        Not all pedophiles [45] have the same motivations: many may have rehabilitated or may never hurt children again. Such a one-size-fits-all approach is unfair and ineffective.

          1.1.3.2.5.1. Pro:
          Many jurisdictions haven't passed Romeo and Juliet [46] defenses to statutory rape laws yet.

          1.1.3.2.5.2. Pro:
          Some of those convicted of pedophilia were only children themselves when the offenses were committed [47], and thus were unable to understand the weight of their actions at the time.

          1.1.3.2.5.3. Con:
          Courts often differentiate between punishments in sentencing [48]. Therefore, in cases where chemical castration is unwarranted, they will likely not be used.

          1.1.3.2.5.4. Con:
          Many criminals undergo parole processes, where they can be assessed and their punishment can be changed over time.

          1.1.3.2.5.5. Pro:
          In 2013, a pedophile in Sweden was allowed [49] to adopt a child because the risk of relapse was considered to be sufficiently low as to not pose a risk.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Forcibly violating the bodily integrity of a person is always an unethical infringement of human rights.

        1.1.3.3.1. Con:
        Pedophiles violate the bodily integrity of others and so restricting [50] their rights is justified.

        1.1.3.3.2. Con:
        The Hippocratic oath is not supported [51] in all cases. There are many people and doctors who support exceptions to the oath [52] for procedures such as abortion or euthanasia.

        1.1.3.3.3. Pro:
        Chemical castration harms one's right to procreate [53] - an integral part of one's bodily autonomy [54] - during the treatment period. This is a disproportionate (p. 2621 [55]) and unnecessary punishment.

          1.1.3.3.3.1. Pro:
          Chemical castration would be a similar violation to forced sterilisation, which is commonly acknowledged as an unethical [56] act.

          1.1.3.3.3.2. Con:
          The effects of the most commonly used drugs for chemical castration, like Depo-Provera, are reversible [57].

          1.1.3.3.3.3. Pro:
          The UK Court of Appeal [58] ruled that pedophiles can have unsupervised access to their children, recognizing their right to family.

        1.1.3.3.4. Con:
        Emergency doctors and surgeons regularly make health decisions for their patients without seeking their consent [59] first.

          1.1.3.3.4.1. Pro:
          Those who are hospitalised with serious mental health illnesses may be made to take types of medications - such as anti-psychotics - sometimes with the use of force and physical restraint [60].

          1.1.3.3.4.2. Con:
          Hospitilization only normally occurs in cases where the person is a danger to themselves or society and is only temporary. Permanently eliminating the sexual desires of a pedophile goes far beyond that.

        1.1.3.3.5. Pro:
        Pedophiles are almost always at least 16 [61] years old and can consent to medical treatment. It is therefore a violation of their bodily integrity to force treatment on them.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    Societies should treat people who are sexually attracted to children as mentally ill [62] rather than as evil.

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      Research [63] suggests that sex offender recidivism rates are reduced after psychological interventions.

        1.1.4.1.1. Con:
        Predictions of risk from psychologists and psychiatrists are highly speculative and often the tools used over-predict risk, often between a third to 50% of the time (p. 46 [64]).

        1.1.4.1.2. Pro:
        The use of medications within a broader psychiatric framework [65] is more useful and sophisticated than chemical castration.

        1.1.4.1.3. Con:
        Research into the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for treating abusive sexual behaviour is mixed [66].

        1.1.4.1.4. Pro:
        There is evidence suggesting that medical conditions [67] can cause pedophilic urges.

        1.1.4.1.5. Pro:
        Experts on pedophilia have said that relapse prevention treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy [68] can help pedophiles control their urges and significantly reduce recidivism rates (p. 118 [69]).

      1.1.4.2. Con:
      Given the existing social prejudices against pedophiles - and criminals in general - it is unlikely that such a social change is possible in the reasonable future.

        1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
        People generally support the imposition of undignified conditions [70] and restrictions on inmates and criminals.

        1.1.4.2.2. Con:
        Many countries, especially Nordic ones [71], prioritizing rehbilitating and supporting criminals. Given this model has been successful, its ideas could spread.

      1.1.4.3. Pro:
      Treating sexual attraction to children as a mental illness would eliminate and delegitimize harmful responses to such people.

        1.1.4.3.1. Pro:
        This system would produce greater research into more effective treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention strategies; more people coming forward increases the number of potential subjects available for psychological study [72].

        1.1.4.3.2. Pro:
        Mandatory reporting laws require medical professionals to report potential pedophiles and lead to barriers to treatment [73]. These may seem less helpful in a medical approach to preventing pedophilia.

          1.1.4.3.2.1. Con:
          Mandatory reporting laws are designed to protect children [74] and ensure they receive support and, if necessary, are removed from an abusive environment.

          1.1.4.3.2.2. Pro:
          The efficacy of mandatory reporting laws for protecting children is highly questionable [75].

        1.1.4.3.3. Con:
        Many of these harmful practices are supported due to the intense anger [76] people feel over sexual crimes against children. This feeling would still exist even in a world where pedophilia is seen as a mental illness.

        1.1.4.3.4. Con:
        Proposals to change these outdated practices may still be stymied due to the cost and lack of attention associated with them.

          1.1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
          Despite people in the US knowing that many prisoners have received false or disproportionate sentences, there is still little support [77] to improve their conditions. The same may happen to pedophiles even if the mental health explanation is accepted.

          1.1.4.3.4.2. Pro:
          A radical change in policy would have significant administrative and implementation costs. This would likely make them unpopular [78].

          1.1.4.3.4.3. Con:
          There is a growing movement towards prison reform and improving conditions for prisoners has become more popular [79] for many.

      1.1.4.4. Pro:
      A pedophile's sexual desires are a largely unchangeable aspect of their sexuality [80]. It would be better, therefore, to prioritize teaching them coping mechanisms rather than punishing them.

        1.1.4.4.1. Pro:
        Pedophiles usually commit crimes due to a lack of self control [81]. The only way to prevent this is to improve the self-control of offenders.

        1.1.4.4.2. Pro:
        Many proven therapies [82] are based on improving people's ability to control their potentially malignant urges.

        1.1.4.4.3. Con:
        If it is the case that these desires are unchangeable, then societies should not allow convicted pedophiles back into society unmonitored.

      1.1.4.5. Con:
      Not all pedophiles abuse children. Those who do so are making a deliberate choice [83] that cannot be excused by mental illness.

        1.1.4.5.1. Pro:
        Many pedophiles [84] know that it would be wrong to act on their desires and choose never to abuse children.

        1.1.4.5.2. Con:
        The fact that they are making a conscious choice to commit a crime does not invalidate the fact that they face mental health issues affecting their desires and inhibitions.

  1.2. Thesis:
  Pedophiles should be monitored once they are released with restrictions placed on their actions and where they can live and placed on a public registry.

    1.2.1. Con:
    Registration and monitoring would expose pedophiles to public suspicion, discrimination, and violence. Some citizens would likely feel justified in judging, discriminating, or even using violence [85] against them.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Sex offenders can seek protection using police and home security systems.

        1.2.1.1.1. Con:
        Mistaken identity is common [86] in cases of vigilante and mob justice. Such policies would also place innocent people at risk [87] even if ex-convicts receive protection.

          1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          Pedophile hunters' activties are often described as 'high risk [88]', as they are often provide unusable evidence. As such, they typically resort to violence rather than investigation.

          1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
          Pedophile hunters are often unable to safeguard [89] children and vulnerable people that may come into contact with their targets.

          1.2.1.1.1.3. Con:
          States can pursue other policies to prevent vigilante justice, like attempting to accomodate local concerns and by humanizing ex-convicts [90].

        1.2.1.1.2. Con:
        Police are often biased [91] against former convicts, meaning their protection may not be reliable.

        1.2.1.1.3. Pro:
        Sex offenders can ensure their houses have alarms and cameras to protect them.

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      Constant suspicion and hatred can isolate offenders and make them less able to build new lives.

        1.2.1.2.1. Con:
        Research has found that community-based [92] forms of policing, including close cooperation with victim advocacy groups, can diminish community anger and offender isolation.

        1.2.1.2.2. Pro:
        Housing prices in single-family residential areas decrease by approximately 2.3% [93] once a sex offender moves into the neighborhood. This can create discrimination and frustration.

        1.2.1.2.3. Pro:
        It is very easy for society to misinterpret sex offense registers and conclude that all registered offenders pose the same risk [94]. Constant suspicion and even discrimination can isolate offenders and make them less able to build new lives.

          1.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
          Sex offender registries should simply be reformed [95] to make them clearer and distinguish categories of offenders.

    1.2.2. Pro:
    Pedophiles should be placed in entirely detached communities.

      1.2.2.1. Con:
      Isolation and separation from society would severely affect people's job opportunities and social lives.

        1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
        Labeling offenders as too dangerous to be allowed to live within a society will vilify them even more (p. 147 [96]).

        1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
        Living away from more densely inhabited areas will make finding employment [97] harder for ex-inmates.

        1.2.2.1.3. Pro:
        Social isolation can have a detrimental effect on an individual's physical [98] and mental health.

          1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
          Socially isolated older men carry a 90% increase [99] in the risk of cardiovascular death.

          1.2.2.1.3.2. Con:
          There are many cases of societies accepting greater amounts of social isolation for people who commit extreme crimes, most notably, in the case of solitary confinement.

            1.2.2.1.3.2.1. Con:
            Many people believe solitary confinement to be exceptionally inhumane [100] and are campaigning to end it. As such, the logics that give rise to such egregious treatment should not be used to justify other forms of isolation.

          1.2.2.1.3.3. Pro:
          A majority of pedophiles, including those who have not acted on their desires, suffer from depression and have suicidal thoughts [101]. Such isolation is only likely to harm their mental health even more.

        1.2.2.1.4. Con:
        Remote work is a growing [102] sector around the world. It would be possible for such individuals to get jobs in this sector.

      1.2.2.2. Pro:
      Placing pedophiles in entirely detached communities will help keep other people safe.

        1.2.2.2.1. Con:
        It would be impossible to ensure that pedophiles remain isolated in these communities.

          1.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
          Tracking devices [103], and other forms of surveillance, could ensure that pedophiles could never leave the community undetected.

          1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro:
          Pedophiles regularly circumnavigate [104] restrictions designed to keep track of them and subsequently disappear from authorities' radars.

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        It is easier for law enforcement to monitor a single area, where residents' whereabouts [105] are known.

          1.2.2.2.2.1. Con:
          Law enforcement will still need to monitor wider society for pedophiles who have not been convicted yet.

        1.2.2.2.3. Con:
        Communities composed entirely of pedophiles may create a culture where child abuse is normalized.

          1.2.2.2.3.1. Con:
          Pedophiles aren't necessarily [106] all child molesters. A detatched community may create a culture where attraction to children is normalized, but where most would still consider acting upon that to be harmful.

            1.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con:
            Communities composed mainly of pedophiles are more likely to foster the growth of pedophile advocacy organisations which seek to normalize [107] sexual activity between adults and children.

          1.2.2.2.3.2. Pro:
          A detached pedophile community would create an enviroment where abusers may perpertrate further acts of abuse.

            1.2.2.2.3.2.1. Pro:
            A detached pedophile community may become an increasingly dangerous environment over time as some start their own families.

              1.2.2.2.3.2.1.1. Con:
              It would be difficult for pedophiles living in an isolated community to start families, as roughly 96% [108] since pedophiles are male.

              1.2.2.2.3.2.1.2. Pro:
              This results in a choice between leaving children to grow up in a potentially extremely dangerous community or taking any pedophiles' children into care, which, if they have shown rehabilitation, is a violation of their parental rights [109].

            1.2.2.2.3.2.2. Con:
            It is easier for law enforcement to monitor and enforce laws in areas primarily occupied by convicted pedophiles.

              1.2.2.2.3.2.2.1. Con:
              Many pro-pedophile groups are still secretly active [110]. They would likely flourish in an all-pedophile community without the social backlash and enforcement that initially led to their closure.

            1.2.2.2.3.2.3. Pro:
            Such groups have been able to lure vulnerable children into their communities to abuse.

              1.2.2.2.3.2.3.1. Con:
              When group trafficking occurs, it is rarely in communities of pedophiles. Instead, it typically has economic causes and purposes [111].

              1.2.2.2.3.2.3.2. Pro:
              Grooming and trafficking often occurs among small groups [112].

              1.2.2.2.3.2.3.3. Con:
              Often 'grooming gangs' and other pedophile groups consist of individuals who have not been previously convicted [113] of child sex abuse.

              1.2.2.2.3.2.3.4. Pro:
              Pro-pedophile groups have been known to instruct members [114] on how to commit sexual abuse.

          1.2.2.2.3.3. Pro:
          Some pedophiles genuinely do not understand [115] why their actions are wrong. Moving them into separate communities will diminish their incentive to rehabilitate as they will not have to interact with children.

        1.2.2.2.4. Pro:
        This will reduce the amount of harm done to children, as it is easier to prevent children from entering a single area.

          1.2.2.2.4.1. Pro:
          Laws can ensure that individual pedophiles are not living near schools or other areas with high numbers of children.

      1.2.2.3. Pro:
      There have been many cases of violence - even murders [116] - motivated [117] by a desire to attack sex offenders.

        1.2.2.3.1. Pro:
        'Pedophile hunters [118]' vigilante groups seek out pedophiles in order to physically assault them.

        1.2.2.3.2. Con:
        Living in a seperate community may subject pedophiles to more regular forms of discrimination and violence.

          1.2.2.3.2.1. Con:
          Vigilante attacks have not affected the Miracle Village [119] in Florida, which one of its residents said "might be the safest place to live" [120].

          1.2.2.3.2.2. Con:
          Vigilantes tend to target pedophiles online [121] through sting operations where they pose as children [122]. Those who are not still trying to meet children online will likely be safe.

          1.2.2.3.2.3. Pro:
          Creating seperate communities for pedophiles would create a clear place where those who wish to do harm can easily find them.

          1.2.2.3.2.4. Pro:
          Ex-convict pedophiles are often targetted in their homes [123] when their address is known by their attacker.

      1.2.2.4. Pro:
      Many sex offenders in Florida freely choose to live in Miracle Village [124], a community for those with sex crime convictions.

        1.2.2.4.1. Con:
        The fact that some convicted pedophiles voluntarily choose to live outside of society does not justify forcing such a decision on all of them.

      1.2.2.5. Con:
      Being required to live in separate communities is a massive restriction of individuals' freedom of choice.

        1.2.2.5.1. Pro:
        Being confined to specific areas would prevent former sex offenders from living full and spontaneous lives.

          1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro:
          Such confinement would make it significantly harder for ex-convicts to move for new jobs, relationships or to where their family, friends and support networks are.

          1.2.2.5.1.2. Con:
          With such a system, all major cities will have areas with former sex offenders. Many states [125] and countries have more basic restrictions where they can live. As such, ex-convicts can move as they need.

        1.2.2.5.2. Con:
        It is legitimate for states to restrict the freedom of movement of those convicted of sex crimes with children.

          1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro:
          States frequently restrict the movements of ex-criminals and potentially dangerous people.

            1.2.2.5.2.1.1. Con:
            The fact that such laws are adopted does not mean they are moral or should be followed.

            1.2.2.5.2.1.2. Pro:
            People on various watchlists [126] are not allowed to travel.

            1.2.2.5.2.1.3. Pro:
            Restraining orders [127] are restrictions on freedom of movement that most people accept the legitimacy of. Restrictions on ex-sex offenders have similar justifications as restraining orders.

          1.2.2.5.2.2. Con:
          Freedom of movement is necessary for individuals to feel free and comfortable in their everyday lives.

            1.2.2.5.2.2.1. Con:
            One can still access other core rights [128], like those to speech, choice, and life, while having restrictions on their movement.

            1.2.2.5.2.2.2. Pro:
            Freedom of movement is an integral part of one's bodily autonomy [129], which is one of the most vital rights an individual possesses.

            1.2.2.5.2.2.3. Pro:
            Lacking the freedom of movement, especially within the place where they live, is likely to make people feel trapped [130].

          1.2.2.5.2.3. Pro:
          All people who commit crimes accept limits on their rights. Movement is an especially important right to restrict, given that pedophiles may use it to target new victims.

        1.2.2.5.3. Con:
        Such a rule would not be a complete restriction of freedom of movement, as ex-convicts would still be allowed to travel [131] where they wish.

    1.2.3. Con:
    Constant monitoring and restrictions will undermine the goals of punishment. Convicted pedophiles should be given the chance to rehabilitate.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      The government, by taking a lenient stance on pedophilia, can help normalise compassion towards pedophiles.

        1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
        Many pedophiles who have not acted on their urges are reluctant to seek help [132] as they have had past experiences of receiving negative judgements when reaching out to others.

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        A government failing to actively condemn pedophiles is likely to be seen as condoning their behaviour.

          1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
          People may feel more justified engaging in vigilante violence against pedophiles if they feel justice has not been served.

          1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro:
          This is particularly likely in the context of the growing political salience of pedophilia accusations [133]. This would make it more likely that there would be an immense backlash to attempts at compassion.

          1.2.3.1.2.3. Con:
          Social change often comes slowly [134] and through careful campaigning. While it may not be possible immediately, such compassion-based views of reforming pedophiles may become more popular.

          1.2.3.1.2.4. Con:
          More compassionate views on crime are being popularized [135] in other areas of crime.

        1.2.3.1.3. Con:
        Pedophilia is globally condemned as a particularly abhorrent action [136]. It is unlikely that people's views will change greatly based on the actions of the government.

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      One significant purpose of imprisonment is to protect society (p. 1 [137]). For cases of pedophilia, this goal is more important than rehabilitation.

        1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
        Not all criminals [138] can be rehabilitated and it is impossible to know which ones can be. As a result, social protection should be prioritized, as it provides a greater guarantee that future crimes will not occur.

        1.2.3.2.2. Con:
        Rehabilitation is a more important goal than protection because, if successful, rehabilitation allows a greater number of people to have full access to their rights after punishment is over.

        1.2.3.2.3. Pro:
        Protection is a more important goal because protecting the rights of the innocent is more important than protecting those of someone who has already committed a crime (p. 1 [139], p. 197 [140]).

      1.2.3.3. Con:
      Pedophilia is an permanent condition [141]. Therefore, rehabilitation ought to take a secondary role to crime prevention. Such monitoring allows pedophiles to have rights while achieving prevention.

        1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
        Differences have been observed between the brains [142] of pedophiles and those of other people.

        1.2.3.3.2. Con:
        While the condition may be permanent, long-term [143] treatment options are available, which would reduce the prevalence of offenses.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    Monitoring - for example, through registers or electronic tags - would ensure that the police can more easily protect children by knowing the locations of pedophiles.

      1.2.4.1. Con:
      Privacy is a basic human right [144]. Releasing the personal data of pedophiles to the public is a violation of this right.

        1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
        Giving out such personal information could lead to pedophiles facing abuse and harassment.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        The right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 [145] of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

        1.2.4.1.3. Con:
        No right is absolute [146]. For example, prisoners have to live with other people in small cells, under constant surveillance.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      Pedophiles will be further deterred from abusing children if they are monitored after release.

        1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
        Some pedophiles do not believe that having sex with children is wrong and even actively advocate it [147]. Monitoring is the only way to protect children from those who cannot or do not want to be rehabilitated.

        1.2.4.2.2. Con:
        At best, this strategy would only work for convicted pedophiles, meaning children would still be at risk from those who have not started or been caught.

        1.2.4.2.3. Pro:
        Pedophiles are usually somewhat aware [148] of the risk of getting caught for their crimes. Removing monitoring and post-release requirements would increase offending as it reduces the expected expense of the crimes.

          1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro:
          Convicted pedophiles are less likely to re-offend [149] if they know they are likely to be caught.

        1.2.4.2.4. Con:
        Studies have found that residency restrictions do not lower rates of recidivism for child sex offenders (p. 1 [150]).

          1.2.4.2.4.1. Pro:
          Many offenders fitted with electronic tags [151] continue to break their curfews and location restrictions as they do not fear the consequences of being caught.

          1.2.4.2.4.2. Con:
          Convicted offenders may avoid any places where it is easiest to commit crimes if they are worried that there will be clear evidence of their location.

          1.2.4.2.4.3. Pro:
          There is no empirical support [152] proving the effectiveness of movement restrictions deterring action. In fact, a number of unintended negative consequences have been found that may aggravate offender risk.

      1.2.4.3. Con:
      Continued monitoring would further ostracise [153] ex-convicts from family and society, making it harder to build new lives and making relapse more likely.

        1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
        Harsh punishments and lifelong requirements leave criminals more prone to recividism [154].

        1.2.4.3.2. Pro:
        Pedophiles are most likely [155] to commit abuses when they feel alone and like they have nothing to lose.

        1.2.4.3.3. Con:
        States can set up forms of community outreach [156] to help ex-convicts forge links while still keeping them monitored.

      1.2.4.4. Pro:
      Many countries with low recidivism rates among pedophiles currently have laws requiring the registration of sex offenders (p. 8 [157]). It is likely those laws contribute to that low rate.

        1.2.4.4.1. Pro:
        An average-size registry decreases crime by approximately 13% (p. 192 [158]).

        1.2.4.4.2. Pro:
        Studies have shown that the existence of a registry can act as a deterrent to potential child abusers (p. 3 [159]).

        1.2.4.4.3. Con:
        A 2012 report (p. 21 [160]) found that placing sex offenders on a registry does not impact recidivism rates.

    1.2.5. Con:
    Those who have face criminal punishment should get a mostly 'clean slate', without the presumption of future guilt.

      1.2.5.1. Pro:
      Punishment should be proportional to the crime committed, meaning that, when one's sentence is over, all forms of punishment must stop as well.

        1.2.5.1.1. Con:
        Past crimes still remain on one's permanent record [161] after their punishment ends, indicating that societies find it justifiable to continue penalizing criminals to some extent.

        1.2.5.1.2. Pro:
        Punishment is not meant to represent a permanent "moral mortgage [162]" that can never be paid off.

      1.2.5.2. Con:
      Restrictions after punishment exist and are justified in many countries.

        1.2.5.2.1. Pro:
        In many states [163] in the US, convicted sex offenders cannot legally live within 500-2,000 feet of schools.

        1.2.5.2.2. Pro:
        Australian law prohibits [164] registered sex offenders from entering child-related jobs.

        1.2.5.2.3. Pro:
        In the UK, rules ensure members of staff in education facilities do not [165] live with anyone previously convicted of a violent or sexual crime to ensure distance between offenders and minors.

        1.2.5.2.4. Con:
        -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.

        1.2.5.2.5. Con:
        Such policies typically are made with the goal of being as minimally restrictive [166] to ex-convicts as possible.

  1.3. Thesis:
  Convicted pedophiles should be prevented from ever returning back to society, either through the death penalty or life imprisonment.

    1.3.1. Con:
    The use of the death penalty could lead to the execution of innocent people [167].

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      In criminal court trials, the burden of proof required for a conviction must be beyond a reasonable doubt [168]. This helps to greatly reduce the likelihood of wrongful execution occurring.

        1.3.1.1.1. Con:
        It is estimated that at least 4% [169] of death row inmates incarcerated since the 1970s in the US have been wrongly sentenced.

        1.3.1.1.2. Con:
        Given many countries' judicial systems are prone to many mistakes [170], the potential costs for the falsely accused should be diminished.

          1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro:
          Wrongful imprisonment can be ended and financially compensated for [171]. Wrongful execution cannot.

          1.3.1.1.2.2. Con:
          If judicial systems are flawed such that they regularly falsely convict people, they should be reformed [172], rather than used to justify giving child sex offenders more lenient punishments.

        1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
        Such a system makes it significantly more likely that a guilty person end up free [173] than an innocent person be punished.

        1.3.1.1.4. Pro:
        Rates of wrongful conviction are extremely low in most countries.

          1.3.1.1.4.1. Con:
          Wrongful conviction is especially likely [174] in cases of sexual assault.

          1.3.1.1.4.2. Pro:
          Estimates of wrongful conviction in the United States suggest only up to 2.3% [175] of all prisoners are innocent.

            1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Con:
            Such a percentage still means that thousands of people [176] are punished each year for crimes they did not commit.

          1.3.1.1.4.3. Con:
          Rates of wrongful conviction are increasing [177] across the developed world.

      1.3.1.2. Pro:
      Child sexual abuse cases are often based solely [178] on the child's accusation. This can often lead to false accusations.

        1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
        People have little protection against false accusations or wrongful prosecution by the police, which destroy the lives [179] of those accused.

          1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          Wrong prosecution also disproportionately affect [180] vulnerable communities. As such, the consequences of them should be minimized.

          1.3.1.2.1.2. Con:
          States have a variety of means they can use to reduce the likelihood [181] of false imprisonments or wrongful punishment.

          1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro:
          Many falsely accused people accept plea bargains [182] for a reduced punishment because they are afraid of facing a harsh punishment should they be found guilty in trial. This would happen more with a death penalty.

        1.3.1.2.2. Con:
        Children tend to minimize (p. 8 [183]) and deny sexual abuse they have faced, rather than exaggerate or over-report such incidents.

        1.3.1.2.3. Pro:
        The number of interviews, style of questioning employed in interviews, emotional tone of interviewer, and social pressure all affect the accuracy of the responses [184] given by children about events they have experienced.

          1.3.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          The repeated questioning of children often causes them to change their answers (p. 11 [185]) as children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the "correct" answer.

          1.3.1.2.3.2. Con:
          Very few children - around 5% - have to appear as witnesses [186] in court. This is largely because most such cases are resolved by plea bargains.

            1.3.1.2.3.2.1. Con:
            Most victims still need to be interviewed by police.

            1.3.1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
            There many difficulties associated with children testifying [187] in court. As such, prosecutors tend to not ask for or rely on their testimony during trials.

        1.3.1.2.4. Con:
        Less than 10% [188] of child sex abuse claims are found to be false accusations.

    1.3.2. Con:
    Long prison sentences and life imprisonment are unnecessarily severe and cruel forms of punishment.

      1.3.2.1. Con:
      Conditions could be improved by giving prisoners a greater amount of political concern and campaigning for reform.

        1.3.2.1.1. Con:
        There are structural causes to the general lack of reform in prisons. Namely, it is caused by little care among the general population for the living conditions of criminals.

          1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Campaigning on prison reform is usually very electorally risky [189] for politicians. As such, this kind of policy is typically pursued outside the public eye, where there is less accountability.

          1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
          Advocacy groups can signficantly influence [190] policy-making. Such groups should be supported and included in policy-making to make life imprisonment more humane.

          1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro:
          Prisoners themselves often have little voice or visibility [191] within greater society. That means it takes a long time for new issues within prisons to come to light and be addressed.

        1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
        There currently exist many campaigns [192] advocating for the improvement of prison conditions. These efforts should be supported so regulations can be strengthened.

      1.3.2.2. Con:
      This problem could be solved by using the death penalty and making reforms to execute convicts quicker.

        1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
        Many prisoners in the US have been waiting on death row for over 20 years [193]. This wait should be reduced.

        1.3.2.2.2. Con:
        The means used to kill people on death row are often inhumane [194].

      1.3.2.3. Pro:
      Prisons can cause significant damage to prisoners' mental and physical health, especially for pedophiles.

        1.3.2.3.1. Pro:
        Convicted pedophiles are at a substantial risk of violent assault - and potentially death [195] - from fellow inmates and prison guards.

        1.3.2.3.2. Pro:
        A lack of care for conditions in prisons has led to diseases spreading easily [196], producing repeated harmful health outcomes for those enduring life imprisonment.

        1.3.2.3.3. Pro:
        Prisoners are typically not given nutritious diets [197] or sufficient opportunity for exercise.

        1.3.2.3.4. Con:
        Improved forms of security [198] in prisons can help mitigate some of the violence currently endemic in many prisons.

        1.3.2.3.5. Con:
        Long and short-term professional psychological therapy could be provided in prisons.

          1.3.2.3.5.1. Con:
          There is little evidence [199] that prison therapy is helpful or effective.

          1.3.2.3.5.2. Pro:
          Such treatment could help prisoners deal more effectively with the difficulties of long prison sentences, reducing levels of stress and anxiety.

    1.3.3. Con:
    Prisons are extremely expensive, especially for long sentences and those on death row. Other, cheaper options should be pursued instead.

      1.3.3.1. Con:
      Providing medical and psychiatric treatment to high-risk offenders comes at a similarly huge cost to the taxpayer.

        1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
        The high cost [200] of attempting to rehabilitate pedophiles should not fall on the shoulders of the taxpayers.

          1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          Many prisoners are able to earn money while incarcerated (p. 5 [201]). Money could be taken from these earnings to contribute towards the cost of rehabilitation before any is taken from the public purse.

            1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Payment for prisoners is typically exploitatitively low [202]. Taxing these earnings will not significant enough to fund such a program.

          1.3.3.1.1.2. Con:
          Taxpayer money routinely funds rehabilitation for offenders of other crimes (p. 4 [203]), including those connected to or triggered by complex psychological disorders proving to reduce recidivism and to improve the inmate's wellbeing and behaviour (p. 15 [204]).

        1.3.3.1.2. Con:
        Given the likelihood that convicted pedophiles will become a part of society upon their release, even under life imprisonment, it is in society's best interests [205] to make sure rehabilitation is as successful as possible.

        1.3.3.1.3. Pro:
        The Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) in the UK is estimated to cost taxpayers over £100 million [206] since it began in 1991.

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      The imprisonment of child sex offenders costs the US around US$5.4 billion [207] annually, exclusive of any other costs.

        1.3.3.2.1. Pro:
        Housing a single prisoner costs an average of around US$45,000 [208] per annum.

        1.3.3.2.2. Con:
        Since is it estimated that as many as 40,000 children [209] born in any year will go on to experience sexual abuse as a minor - and taking into accout the lifetime cost [210] of caring for a victim - imprisonment may prevent further crimes and substantially lower the overall economic burden.

      1.3.3.3. Con:
      The chemicals involved in castration (e.g. Lupron [211]) are also very expensive.

        1.3.3.3.1. Pro:
        The monthly dose of Lupron costs US$800 [212], as well as initial assessment costs of US$1,500-2,500.

        1.3.3.3.2. Con:
        The annual cost of imprisoning someone in the United States is US$31,307 [213], which works out at US$2,608.92 per month, or 326% of the monthly cost of Lupron.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    Permanent punishments act as an effective deterrents to those considering committing crimes of child sexual assault.

      1.3.4.1. Con:
      The fear of being caught and eventually killed might drive pedophiles to murder their victims so that they cannot give evidence to convict them.

        1.3.4.1.1. Pro:
        Murder rates are consistently higher [214] in American states where the dealth penalty is used.

          1.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
          Both variables could be caused by other factors [215], like unsuccessful rehabilitation programs, poverty rates, culture, and conservative governments.

          1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro:
          Even if the death penalty itself does not incentivize more murders, its use is typically associated with systems that care less about convict rehabilitation.

        1.3.4.1.2. Con:
        Murdering victims would put pedophiles at much greater risk [216] of being caught. As such, murder rates are unlikely to grow.

      1.3.4.2. Con:
      Pedophiles, like other criminals, do not always rationally premeditate [217] their actions. Harsher punishments would not necessarily change the likelihood of them committing crimes.

        1.3.4.2.1. Pro:
        Research tends to emphasize how pedophilia is a 'disorder [218]', which individuals are ashamed of. Consequently, many of their actions are impulsive and not rationally planned.

        1.3.4.2.2. Pro:
        Pedophiles tend to assume they will not be caught, largely because child sex abuse is often underreported.

          1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro:
          Many sexual offenses are never reported [219]; one study found only 12% of child sex abuse cases are reported [220].

          1.3.4.2.2.2. Pro:
          Many children are abused by someone they know. This may make them less likely to report the crime if they fear for their abuser's life (p. 5 [221]).

            1.3.4.2.2.2.1. Pro:
            90% [222] of victims of child sexual abuse know their abuser.

            1.3.4.2.2.2.2. Pro:
            50% [223] of child sexual abuses cases against victims under 6 years old are carried out by a family member.

            1.3.4.2.2.2.3. Con:
            This problem is being tackled by increasing counselling [224] for children in safe places, namely schools, so that it is easier to identify the signs of abuse. As these schemes grow, the deterrent will grow.

          1.3.4.2.2.3. Pro:
          When it is reported, child sexual abuse is often revealed after many years [225], when evidence and potential witnesses are scarce.

            1.3.4.2.2.3.1. Pro:
            A Canadian survey [226] of adults who were abused as children revealed that 58% took five years or longer to disclose the abuse. Around 20% never disclosed the abuse.

          1.3.4.2.2.4. Con:
          In the UK, the rate of convictions [227] for child sex abuse is growing, meaning that this could become an increasingly effective deterrent over time.

          1.3.4.2.2.5. Con:
          Pedophiles often act on the basis of ease, leading to the increased use of the internet for grooming, even though it is easier for authorities [228] to identify them there.

        1.3.4.2.3. Con:
        The acts of pedophiles, particularly grooming, are often planned [229] in advance. They likely weigh up the probability of being caught and therefore can be confronted by regular deterrent methods.

          1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro:
          Many sexual predators spend years working to put themselves in positions [230] to victimize children, for example, by finding employment as teachers, priests, or coaches.

          1.3.4.2.3.2. Con:
          In most pre-meditated crimes, criminals are able to convince themselves that they will not get caught [231], either because they can hide their crime or because they believe the system is flawed (p. 840 [232]).

          1.3.4.2.3.3. Con:
          Most premeditated [233] crimes are not affected by conventional deterrent methods. This is because criminals are usually more concerned with other risks, like being caught by others in the act.

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      The death penalty is an extremely effective deterrent because humans value their own lives - and fear death [234] - above anything else.

        1.3.4.3.1. Pro:
        Any contemporary lack of deterrence is often a result of offenders not understanding how authorities may catch them. Online deterrence campaigns [235] can rectify this and reduce offences.

        1.3.4.3.2. Pro:
        Some evidence [236] suggests the death penalty is not currently a deterrent only because of the long waits on 'death row'. If countries executed criminals quicker, the death penalty could be more effective.

          1.3.4.3.2.1. Con:
          Deterrents tend to be most effective in situations where punishment is obvious and imminent [237]. Even under ideal circumstances, the death penalty never works as such.

            1.3.4.3.2.1.1. Con:
            One study found that the death penalty produces lower crime rates even for crimes of passion [238].

            1.3.4.3.2.1.2. Pro:
            Studies have found that the certainty of being caught increases the deterrent of punishment, not the scale of the punishment itself (p. 6 [239]).

          1.3.4.3.2.2. Pro:
          When the wait on death row is extremely long, the deterrent of the death penalty is no different to that implied by life imprisonment.

        1.3.4.3.3. Con:
        Academic research has found no significant evidence [240] that the death penalty deters murder.

          1.3.4.3.3.1. Con:
          The findings for murder are likely not applicable to pedophile, as many murders are not premeditated [241], either because they are done in passion, under the influence of substances, or due to mental illness.

          1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro:
          The academic consensus against the death penalty's deterrence effect is as strong as that which exists regarding the existence of man-made climate change [242].

      1.3.4.4. Pro:
      Prisons often involve low standards of living and significant restrictions on the freedom of individuals. As a result, people will rationally seek to avoid getting sent to one.

        1.3.4.4.1. Con:
        Studies repeatedly find [243] that long prison sentences do not act as a deterrent and have not lowered crime rates.

        1.3.4.4.2. Pro:
        Prisons deprive inmates of several important social activities, including those with friends and family, leading to a significant decrease in their freedoms and quality of life (p. 1 [244]).

        1.3.4.4.3. Pro:
        Around the world, prisons are overcrowded or have bad conditions [245]. Criminals rationally seek to avoid these.

    1.3.5. Pro:
    Convicted pedophiles pose a threat that requires more substantive legal measures than other crimes do; as such they should be kept apart from society.

      1.3.5.1. Pro:
      Permanent punishments would ensure there is no risk of convicts re-offending.

        1.3.5.1.1. Con:
        Many prisoners who get life sentences are still able to leave prison eventually, for example, due to parole [246].

        1.3.5.1.2. Pro:
        In extreme cases, prevention should become the most important purpose of punishment. This is why permanent punishments are used for crimes like mass killing and terrorism [247].

        1.3.5.1.3. Con:
        A study found that most individuals convicted of sexual abuse - including child sexual abuse - did not re-offend sexually after their release (p. ii [248]).

          1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro:
          One study in Australia found recidivism rates of 17% within two years [249].

            1.3.5.1.3.1.1. Con:
            This number is well below [250] the average rate of recidivism in Australia, suggesting the quantity is not being reported correctly.

              1.3.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              -> See 1.3.4.2.2.1.

          1.3.5.1.3.2. Con:
          Though most pedophiles do not re-offend (p. 7 [251]), a study found that 23% of child molesters were likely to commit other sexual crimes within 15 years. That still puts a significant number of children at risk.

          1.3.5.1.3.3. Pro:
          A meta-analysis [252] of 61 studies found that sex offenders are more likely to re-offend with a non-sexual offense [253] than a sexual offense.

            1.3.5.1.3.3.1. Con:
            Some offences labelled as 'non-sexual' may still be sexually motivated [254] when the underlying behaviour is properly assessed.

              1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
              Crimes such as murder and kidnapping are often sexually motivated especially if perpetrated by sex offenders (p. 526 [255]).

          1.3.5.1.3.4. Con:
          52% of child molesters re-offend (p. 11 [256]).

          1.3.5.1.3.5. Con:
          Unlike other crimes that can have clear material aims, pedophilia is a crime that is psychological [257] in its motivations. This makes it more dangerous to reintegrate ex-convicts into society.

      1.3.5.2. Pro:
      Sexual abuse is a particularly heinous and dangerous crime, especially for children. As a result, it should be punished in a more punitive fashion [258] than other forms of abuse.

        1.3.5.2.1. Con:
        By this logic, anyone who poses a serious threat to children's physical and mental health should be given the death penalty. However, very few advocate this for abusive parents, which similarly traumatizes vulnerable children.

        1.3.5.2.2. Pro:
        Suicide attempts are between 10% and 13% [259] higher for victims of child sexual abuse than the general population.

        1.3.5.2.3. Pro:
        Children are known to suffer extreme mental health [260] complications and developmental issues [261] as a result of abuse (pp.1-2 [262]).

      1.3.5.3. Con:
      Punishment should be determined by more factors [263] than just the harm caused.

        1.3.5.3.1. Pro:
        Execution gives individuals no opportunity to reform [264], rehabilitate [265], and return to society. These are also core purposes of punishment.

        1.3.5.3.2. Pro:
        All people deserve the chance to live free lives.

          1.3.5.3.2.1. Con:
          Rights are given to individuals under the assumption that they accept the terms of a basic social contract [266]. Those who violate those terms do not have full access to their rights.

          1.3.5.3.2.2. Pro:
          Most societies accept a higher risk of crime [267] and re-offending to allow for all people to have access to their rights to privacy and legal equality.

          1.3.5.3.2.3. Pro:
          Human lives are valuable because individuals have the ability to pursue unique and subjective goals [268]. This ability, therefore, must be protected by states.

        1.3.5.3.3. Con:
        Sexual abuse does irreversible harm [269] to children, who are some of the most vulnerable people in society. As such, prevention should be the most important concern in such cases.

"He and Bethan were married when their daughter was born and so he retains parental rights, allowing him at least a say over his child's health, education and living arrangements.

Bethan is "absolutely petrified" about what will happen once he is freed from prison. She fears he might take their daughter out of school one day without her knowledge, and the only way to get the child back will be to go through the family court. And while he has their child, he could do to her what he did to the other children he abused."

[4] https://ssaic.ca/learn/triggers-what-are-they/
"Many people are familiar with the phenomenon of soldiers coming home from war with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When soldiers are triggered, they may experience flashbacks, memories, or panic attacks; this happens when something reminds them of a traumatic experience they have endured. Survivors of sexualized violence often experience PTSD symptoms and triggers in the same way, as both war and sexualized violence create similar imprints in the brain.

A trigger is something that sets off a memory tape or flashback, transporting the person back to the event of the original trauma and causing the individual to experience overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms or thoughts. The individual will react to this trigger with an emotional intensity similar to the time of the trauma."

"Pedophilia is a form of paraphilia. Because it causes harm to others, it is considered a disorder."
[6] https://theconversation.com/psychology-of-a-paedophile-why-are-some-people-attracted-to-children-59991
"When it comes to preferential – or fixated – child sex offenders, some don’t even realise what they are doing is wrong. They genuinely believe they are showing the children “love”.

Shocking as that may be to those who don’t share their sexual attraction to children, this is why one serial sex offender told me he offends. He understands that society deems what he did was wrong, but he can’t understand why this is the case."
[7] https://www.thejournal.ie/paedophile-therapy-3052076-Oct2016/
"Launched some 11 years ago, the largely publicly funded project by Berlin’s top university hospital Charite calls on paedophiles to undertake a treatment that helps them control their urges.

More than 7,000 people have sought information on the programme which is offered in 11 centres across Germany.

Of these, 659 people have undertaken the therapy, with 251 completing the entire programme. Another 265 are currently being given treatment either in group or individual sessions.

The German initiative is unique because it deals with potential sex criminals, or those who have already committed abuses but have managed to escape justice."
[8] https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-germany-treats-paedophiles-before-they-offend
"By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project’s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.

But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. “I meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.”"
[9] https://unherd.com/2022/01/inside-germanys-paedophile-experiment/
"Does it work? For Ruby and Sirius, it appears that talking to one another about their urges has helped them to keep them under control. But until they collect sufficient data, it is impossible to know if the clinic’s claims are true.

And so we’re left with a debate that is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. On one side of the argument are those who point to the fact that Don’t Offend has enquiries from prospective patients from all over the world, with many moving to Germany for the therapy. On the other, there are those who’d rather point to the message recently scrawled outside von Heyden’s office: “Hang the Paedos.”"

"As a general rule, cognitive-behavioral therapies and relapse prevention strategies, including group therapies aimed at confronting and supporting patients as they struggle with denial, cognitive distortions, and social skills deficits, are helpful for patients like Mr. Green [7]. As an expert in dynamic psychotherapy, Dr. Gregory may not have significant experience with these modalities or the “containment” model for working with paraphilic patients who have abused children or are at risk for doing so."

[12] https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-12592-013.html
"The reasons for doing so are partly based on research evidence indicating that social disconnection and relationship ruptures related to empathy failures often trigger offending, and also because it is hard for people to grasp how individuals can inflict severe harm on others without lacking empathic capacities."
[13] https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/29/prisoner-rehabilitation-does-not-work-says-former-prisons-boss
"A former director general of the Prison Service has said rehabilitation of offenders in jail does not work and should be scrapped.

Sir Martin Narey will say in a speech on Tuesday that research to establish a causal link between rehabilitation and reduced reoffending is lacking and short courses cannot fix problems caused by difficult childhoods.

“The things we did to prisoners, the courses we put them on, the involvement of charities, made little or no difference,” he will tell the International Corrections and Prisons Association conference in Buenos Aires."
[14] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48998136
"Ms Hopkins said the MoJ had "allowed people to continue attending the course" while knowing "it could be harmful".

She indicated that victims and convicted perpetrators of sex attacks, who were told to complete SOTP, could sue the government if the crimes would otherwise not have taken place."
[15] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82d169ed915d74e6237c91/sotp-report-web-.pdf
"It is also possible that attendance on the Core prison-based SOTP may increase the propensity to sexually re-offend amongst sex offenders. This may have been as a result of the sole emphasis on group treatment: recent meta-analysis has indicated the importance of including more individualized modules in sex offender treatment (Schmucker & Lösel, 2015).
A lack of tailoring has also been suggested as an explanatory factor for the failure of a randomised control trial by Marques et al. (2005) to show a treatment effect – Marshall and
Marshall (2007) noted that the programme’s detailed delivery manual constrained the ability of those delivering it to adapt to the particular needs of individual participants. Group treatment may also ‘normalise’ individuals’ behaviour: when stories are shared, their behaviour may not be seen as wrong or different; or at worst, contacts and sources associated with sexual offending may be shared."
[16] https://theconversation.com/helping-to-rehabilitate-sex-offenders-is-controversial-but-it-can-prevent-more-abuse-111861
"Some of the traditional approaches to working with people with sexual convictions have an unproven evidence base. These include programmes that focus on encouraging victim empathy and tackling denial, rather than on skills to lead a good and better life. While getting a person to admit to their offending feels right, for example, it’s not related to reducing reoffending.

Notification schemes that enable members of the public to request information about people who are in contact with their child, also “feel” like a good idea. They may bring comfort to people, but there is limited evidence for their effectiveness and some to suggest they are ineffective."
[17] https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-38742-001
"Cognitive-behavioral and multi-systemic treatment as well as studies with small samples, medium- to high-risk offenders, more individualized treatment, and good descriptive validity revealed better effects."

"Research shows that interventions with people with sexual convictions appear to be more effective in the community than in prison, which is why there is a real need for better community reintegration and rehabilitation.

This is why initiatives such as Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) have been shown to work. In these interventions, between three and five trained volunteers provide social, emotional and practical support for high-risk sexual offenders. In one evaluation in Minnesota, those taking part in a CoSA programme had their risk of rearrest for a sexual offence reduced by 88%."
[19] https://www.voa.org/homelessness-and-prisoner-re-entry/
"Individuals active in addiction have difficulty paying rent, are most times in arrears, and often face eviction. The provision of voluntary supportive services that encourage clients with behavioral health issues to remain stably housed is critical.

Although collaboration has spurred interest in frequent users of the jail and partnerships to integrate care, little attention and priority is given to those facing homelessness on returning from prison. It is acknowledged that repeated incarceration often fails to modify the behavior that leads to recurrent arrests and that incarceration is not an effective strategy for rehabilitation (MacDonald, 2015, p. 2265). However, the causes of homelessness after being released from prison or jail are both systemic and reflective of the extraordinary needs of people who are inevitably returning to the community. Successful models do exist for prisoners facing homelessness and warrant consideration for replicability."

"Chemical castration, sometimes called medical castration, refers to the use of chemicals or drugs to stop sex hormone production. While many people know about this process as a way to stop sex offenders, medical castration is used as a treatment for tumors that feed on sex hormones. The treatment, also called hormone therapy, may be used to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer."

"These days, the treatment is associated with sex offenders or people with troubling sexual fantasies they fear they will act on. In 2000, doctors started using a drug designed to treat prostate cancer to lower men’s sexual urges. The drug Lupron tricks the hormone in the brain that tells the pituitary gland to produce testosterone."

"Androgens stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. The main androgens in the body are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Most androgens are made by the testicles, but the adrenal glands (glands that sit above your kidneys) as well as the prostate cancer cells themselves, can also make androgens.

Lowering androgen levels or stopping them from getting into prostate cancer cells often makes prostate cancers shrink or grow more slowly for a time."

"Writing in the Prison Service Journal in 2008, Karen Harrison, a senior law lecturer at the University of the West of England, outlined some of the issues in using the antiandrogen drug, cyproterone acetate, to reduce re-offending rates in sex offenders. Although the drug usually led to a drop in sexual desire, the effective dose varied enormously, from as little as 10mg per week to 200mg per day."

"He was also gay, and in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency - the catch-all legal term used to prosecute any consenting sexual acts between two men. The judge at his trial, acknowledging the importance of Turing's work, laid down what seemed at the time to be a lenient sentence. The mathematician was spared jail and ordered to undergo an experimental hormone therapy for homosexual urges, often dubbed "chemical castration". We know now the treatment will not have affected his orientation or desires, but it did cause physical changes including breast enlargement and erectile dysfunction.

Turing described the experience as horrible and humiliating and less than two years later, he died of cyanide poisoning. An inquest recorded a verdict of suicide. It is a tragic, shameful episode in our recent history, but while the tragedy was Turing's, the shame was entirely the nation's."

"We often talk about the disturbingly high numbers of people with mental health disorders locked up in prisons and jails. But less attention is paid to the ways in which incarceration itself perpetuates this problem by creating and worsening symptoms of mental illness. Research shows that, while it varies from person to person, incarceration is linked to mood disorders including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.

The carceral environment can be inherently damaging to mental health by removing people from society and eliminating meaning and purpose from their lives. On top of that, the appalling conditions common in prisons and jails — such as overcrowding, solitary confinement, and routine exposure to violence — can have further negative effects. Researchers have even theorized that incarceration can lead to “Post-Incarceration Syndrome,” a syndrome similar to PTSD, meaning that even after serving their official sentences, many people continue to suffer the mental effects."

They report substantial decreases in general health (d=-0.52) and life satisfaction (d=-0.84) as well as an increased number of health problems (d = 0.71). However, sport has a potential to buffer this decline of health. Prisoners engaged in sports report a less negative development of their health compared to inactive prisoners. The greater the amount of time spent with sports activities, the better are the health trajectories found."

"Sex offending is often not about sex at all, but about violence and domination. The drugs used will not affect those attitudes. Some men may inflict other types of deviant behaviour on victims if they are unable to perform sexually due to the drugs. The physical impact of the drugs can be very powerful, with the effect being similar to a sex change."
[33] https://neuroanthropology.net/2010/05/10/inside-the-mind-of-a-pedophile/
"Case studies indicate that cerebral dysfunction may be a contributing or dominant factor of pedophilia (Scott, 1984), including problems with self-control, extreme urges, and cognitive distortions. Many experts also believe that disorders for sexual preferences emerge from childhood experiences during critical periods in human development (DiChristina, 2009). In many cases, child sex abusers suffer from traumatic experiences during their childhood.

More specifically, pedophiles tend to also have been molested as children. As children, they lacked the ability to control the situation. By sexually assaulting children, pedophiles attempt to re-live the trauma they experienced and they learn how to master it. A complete role reversal gives them the upper hand and prevents them from being victimized. Overall, through the impact of cerebral dysfunction and traumatic development, the sexual urges and desires for children can become ingrained within a person’s nervous system."

"To explain how it operates, Fabian Saleh, director of the Sexual Violence Prevention & Risk Management Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, compares the drug to appetite suppressants. He says Lupron enables “carefully selected patients [to] gain control over their lives so they are not consumed day in and day out with wanting to have sex with a child.” Each doctor has his or her own analogy; Sorrentino suggests Lupron’s mechanism is akin to the volume being lowered on a radio. Either way, they both contend that Lupron’s effects are impressive. “In this field, you don’t often see profound changes. But when you do, it’s memorable,” Sorrentino says. “People get better with psychology, but it’s different than people getting better with an antibiotic.”"

"Medical considerations are also important, and contemporary doctors should be knowledgeable of these issues. First, chemical castration is no longer effective after it is discontinued; therefore, the spontaneity for receiving medication is prerequisite to overcoming this limitation. World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines suggest that combined psychotherapy and pharmacological therapy is associated with better efficacy compared with either treatment as monotherapy."

HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is responsible for NPS recruitment, but since reforms were introduced six years ago, Russell said, “not one of the NPS divisions has been fully staffed. A steady state has never been achieved.”

He added: “At the time of this inspection, there were 615 probation officer vacancies across the NPS. The service is especially short of this crucial grade of staff, who play a vital role in rehabilitating offenders and protecting the public. The problem is especially acute in London and the South East.”

Some programs provide services for 8 or more hours a day, 5–7 days a week, with clinical staff available days and evenings. Other residential programs are recovery homes for employed offender-clients, with evening and weekend treatment and limited onsite staff. Facilities may include hospitals or hospital-based programs, institutional housing, sections of apartment complexes, and dormitorylike residences."

"Regardless, Depo-Provera has been proven to inhibit the abilities of pedophilias to assault children. The progesterone in Depo-Provera counteracts the biological tendencies that lead men to rape children (4). By lowering testosterone, Depo-Provera reduces sex drive (6). Males can have sexual intercourse (7) but do not want to. Depo-Provera also decreases aggressive tendencies by reducing testosterone. "[T]he castrated criminal would be more docile and have a better opportunity to be rehabilitated, educated, and to become a worthwhile citizen" (1).

There are some parallels to iatrogenetic medical practices in which one problem is cured, but at a cost of creating another. Technical efforts to insure conformity may be hindered by conflicting goals, unintended consequences, displacement, lessened equity, complacency, neutralization, invalidity, escalation, system overload, a negative image of personal dignity and the danger of the means determining, or becoming ends."

"Consider the following: many people with pedophilia (1) hate their desires, (2) do not act on them for moral reasons (and should therefore plausibly be praised rather than vilified), and yet (3) often do not seek treatment precisely because they are aware that people in general cannot seem to tell the difference between:

(a) feeling involuntarily sexually attracted to young children (not wrong in and of itself), and

(b) molesting or sexually assaulting children (very wrong in and of itself, no matter the reason).

And here’s the kicker: failing to seek treatment for (a) is precisely the sort of thing that makes (b) more likely to happen. So, please, whatever your politics — stop saying Roy Moore has been “accused of pedophilia” (he has not). Say instead: “he has been accused of sexually assaulting a minor.”"

Factors to consider

The sentence will be influenced by a number of factors; principally:

- the circumstances of the case

- sharing medical information with patients
- avoiding conflicts of interest, such as profiting by ordering unnecessary tests or treatments
- protecting patients who enroll in research studies

Its principles are held sacred by doctors to this day.

Some say that the oath is irrelevant in modern medical practice because it does not address ethical issues that are relevant today. It is still an invaluable moral guide and has been adopted by the AMA and WMA. Many medical schools still administer a version of the Hippocratic Oath to its graduates."

"However, it is one thing to claim that offenders have forfeited their right to free movement and association (which may be understood to safeguard ordinary citizens from being incarcerated against their will); it is quite another to claim that they have also forfeited their right to refuse a medical treatment. Indeed, the right to refuse medical treatment is bound up with the offender’s right to bodily integrity, and, some might claim, a putative right to mental integrity. In order for this argument in favour of compulsory chemical castration to get off the ground, one would need to explain why offenders have also forfeited these rights."

Although the practice conflicts with their ethical duties, many physicians still forcibly sterilize HIV-positive women in an attempt to limit mother-to-child transmission of the virus [4-7]. This practice further marginalizes these women, who can already face discrimination due to the stigmas associated with womanhood and HIV [8]. South Africa, Namibia, and Chile all provide examples of the widespread use of and legal advocacy against this marginalizing practice [1, 2, 4, 9-17]. This is clearly a pressing ethical problem that reflects global discrimination against women with HIV.

"Forced medication is the commonest method used on psychiatric wards to contain mentally ill patients who are violent toward themselves or others [1], while seclusion is the preferred measure in the Netherlands. These measures are controversial, because while they are intended to protect patients and those around them, they restrict freedom and are usually applied against a patient’s will. This causes serious ethical dilemmas for patients, their caregivers, clinicians and policymakers.

Forced medication is defined as the administration, with or without seclusion or restraint, of a rapid tranquilizer. By temporarily restricting the patient’s freedom of movement, it is intended to control his or her behavior in a way that reduces the risk to their own safety or that of others [2]. Seclusion involves placing a service user in a locked room from which free exit is denied; it also involves isolation and the reduction of sensory stimuli [3]."

"Medications can be used in conjunction with therapy to treat pedophilic disorder. Such medications include medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) and leuprolide acetate (Lupron), and antiandrogens to lower sex drive. Intensity of sex drive is not consistently related to the behavior of pedophilia and high levels of circulating testosterone do not predispose a male to pedophilia. Hormones such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and cyproterone acetate decrease the level of circulating testosterone, potentially reducing sex drive and aggression. These hormones, typically used in tandem with behavioral and cognitive treatments, may reduce the frequency of erections, sexual fantasies, and initiation of sexual behaviors, including masturbation and intercourse. Antidepressants such as fluoxetine have also been found to decrease sex drive but have not effectively targeted sexual fantasies."

"We found only seven small trials (all published more than 20 years ago) that examined the effects of a limited number of drugs. Investigators reported issues around acceptance and adherence to treatment. We found no studies of the newer drugs currently in use, particularly SSRIs or GnRH analogues. Although there were some encouraging findings in this review, their limitations do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding pharmacological intervention as an effective intervention for reducing sexual offending.

The tolerability, even of the testosterone‐suppressing drugs, was uncertain given that all studies were small (and therefore underpowered to assess adverse effects) and of limited duration, which is not consistent with current routine clinical practice. Further research is required before it is demonstrated that their administration reduces sexual recidivism and that tolerability is maintained."

"People with Klüver-Bucy Syndrome experience runaway sexual urges — sometimes including pedophilia — due to damage to their brains. Does the existence of this disorder mean none of us really has control over our sexual behavior?

That's the question Jesse Bering poses in his Slate piece on Klüver-Bucy. Triggered by brain surgery, tumors, encephalitis, or in some cases epilepsy, the syndrome is characterized by hyperorality (the compulsion to put things in one's mouth) and hypersexuality. Bering describes patients who masturbate compulsively, and others who, seemingly out of the blue, begin to make sexual advances on family members or on children. He mentions one man who, after epileptic seizures, compulsively raped his wife, and another man who developed pedophilic urges while suffering a brain tumor (when the tumor was removed, they went away). Based on these cases, Bering asks,"

"It’s time to revisit these categorical exclusions. Without legal protection, a pedophile cannot risk seeking treatment or disclosing his status to anyone for support. He could lose his job, and future job prospects, if he is seen at a group-therapy session, asks for a reasonable accommodation to take medication or see a psychiatrist, or requests a limit in his interaction with children. Isolating individuals from appropriate employment and treatment only increases their risk of committing a crime."

So researchers next tried a more actuarial approach. They set about
measuring dozens of factors from 22,500 sex offenders who were about to
be released. At the end of the study, they computed which factors best ex-
plained the reoffence rates, and from those data they were able to build
actuarial tables to be used in sentencing."

There’s a rehabilitative reason for having so many prisons in a relatively small country. The Norwegian government believes that incarcerated individuals should be geographically close to their homes, so they can maintain relationships with spouses, friends, and family.

 

Many Norwegian prisons allow prisoners to have visitors up to three times per week. They even allow conjugal visits with spouses. There is a strong emphasis placed on relationships so that incarcerated individuals have a strong support system after their release."

"Opponents of routine mandatory reporting are concerned that reporting of competent patients who could otherwise act on their own behalf violates their autonomy and confidentiality. Consequently, these patients may place less trust in their physicians. Some individuals may fear retribution by the accused following reporting. Under such circumstances, patients may avoid the ED for their care. Other barriers to mandatory reporting include lack of time and knowledge, vague definitions, fear of offending patients, families or private physicians, uncertainty, and the reluctance to be drawn into civil lawsuits."

When the consultation is eventually launched, it is most likely to seek views on the introduction of mandatory reporting for those who work in Regulated Activities as defined by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.

These include employees working in positions of trust in roles such as healthcare, education, children’s homes, sports organisations and faith settings to mention a few.

For example, some places (such as New Jersey USA), require all citizens to report abuse, whilst others (such as the Yukon Territory in Canada) require a minimum group of professionals to report. Currently, in Australia there are debates about repealing mandatory reporting because of an overwhelming level of low level reporting which means they don’t have the capacity to respond to the serious cases."

"Present results demonstrate that media coverage of pedophilia was perceived as mostly undifferentiated, even though participants observed an increase in fact-based reporting over the years. Moreover, it seems that media coverage has strong emotional and behavioral consequences for patients (e.g., negative reporting reduced self-esteem). In sum, our results highlight that differentiated media coverage could play a key role in supporting help-seeking persons with pedophilic disorder, while the impact of undifferentiated media coverage appears to be mostly negative. Therefore, our results point to the need to reframe pedophilia using differentiated media coverage to help affected persons receive treatment efficiently and thereby prevent CSA."

"According to the research, Changing Public Attitudes Toward the Criminal Justice System, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, public opinion on crime and criminal justice has fundamentally shifted over the past few years. Today, the public favors dealing with the roots of crime over strict sentencing by a two-to-one margin, 65 percent to 32 percent. This is a dramatic change from public attitudes in 1994, when the Gallup Organization found 48 percent of Americans favored addressing the causes of crime and 42 percent preferred the punitive approach.

This shift has primarily come in the attitudes of those groups that traditionally favored a punitive approach to criminal justice. Today, a solid majority of every demographic group—including men, whites, and people with less than a college degree—support an approach dealing with the causes of crime. Even self-identified Republicans, who favored punishment and enforcement in 1994, now prefer a more progressive approach."

"Paedophilia is a “sexual orientation” like being straight or gay, according to a criminal psychologist.

The idea that sexual attraction to children is an “orientation” is highly controversial as it suggests that offenders cannot change.

But, writing on the Reddit networking website, the psychologist said it was possible to treat child sex abusers on “the understanding that the attraction may always remain”.

The psychologist set up the “ask me anything” thread on Reddit. Their identity was not revealed but was verified by the website.

Asked “can paedophiles actually change?”, the expert wrote: “I believe Paedophilic Disorder is a sexual orientation with individual that are attracted to child features. In other words, an individual with paedophilia has the same ingrained attraction that a heterosexual female may feel towards a male, or a homosexual feels towards their same gender."

The HSP is a revised version of the accredited Healthy Sexual Functioning Programme (HSFP) which was accredited for delivery in custody in 2004."

"The reality is that the evidence these un-vetted and amateur groups gather generally falls far below professional law enforcement agencies’ standards. Often it is obtained via entrapment – a deeply problematic tactic which police officers are correctly barred from using.

The overall result is that paedophile hunters can actually damage the cause of child safety they claim to champion.

More than one paedophile hunter has been arrested for blackmail. One was accused of giving inaccurate and misleading evidence in court.

There is also a fear, as voiced by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), that these groups may actually put children at risk. This can happen if a suspect, having been confronted by vigilantes, acts to ensure further evidence of his offending remains hidden."

On the contrary, according to a separate survey of 439 inmates and ex-convicts, 87.3 percent of the respondents said that in their later brushes with law enforcement officials, these authorities did not trust their word. Many ex-convicts complained that law enforcement officials did not give them a chance to state their side of the situation, instead trying to lay the blame at their feet."

"From a community policing perspective, notification meetings are designed as proactive opportunities to engage and educate the public in a constructive, problem-solving dialogue. Citizens are afforded the opportunity to ask questions, clarify the issues, voice their concerns, and explore potential ways in which they can prevent sexual victimization in their homes and communities. This approach is also more likely to achieve the intended goals of community notification and minimize the potential for unanticipated effects
(e.g., increased fear among citizens, hostility directed toward offenders) that can occur when notification is conducted in the absence of a well-coordinated, deliberate, and thoughtful strategy."

"That’s a pretty heavy rap sheet, I say. So why should we care? Why should anybody have empathy for someone who kidnapped a 14-year-old boy?

Yunus and his lawyers stress that in prison he cleaned up his life, weaning himself from the criminal life, taking a degree through outreach from Bard college and studying the law. “If you made a mistake in your life, you did something wrong, we live in a country where sometimes you get a second chance,” he says. I should be allowed to rehabilitate myself in society.”

But there’s another reason for caring about his story that actually has very little to do with him. It’s that Yunus’s treatment in the hands of the authorities since his release in July 2016 makes no sense, and nonsensical laws tend to be bad laws."

Vilification of sex offenders has resulted in the passage of laws and sanctions that have broad public support, are politically advantageous to support, and give the illusion of increasing society's safety from sexual violence. But there is no evidence they fulfill this promise. The registries, notification requirements, and housing restrictions make it far harder for sex offenders to turn around their lives and succeed in society. In such cases they may become more, rather than less likely to reoffend."

Studies have shown increased platelet aggregation, instability of the autonomic nervous system, hypertension, arthritis, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation in persons reporting feelings of being isolated or lonely. The risk of cardiovascular death increases by 90%, the risk of death from an accident or suicide attempt has been shown to double, the risk of having a nonfatal coronary event in the lonely or isolated older adult increases by 29%, the risk of having a stroke by 32%, and the risk of developing dementia by 50%."

People in solitary, in fact, attempt suicide at a much higher rate than those in the general population. What’s more, solitary is disproportionately used for people with mental illnesses, people of color, and people with disabilities.

In the late 1990s, the FDC was sued by a statewide class of incarcerated people because of its dangerous and inhumane solitary confinement practices. That lawsuit, Osterback v. Moore, resulted in limited reforms. Unfortunately, after the Osterback settlement, solitary confinement in Florida’s prisons did not end, it merely evolved."

When predators ignore reminders that they are talking to “children”, hunters expose them in livestreamed “stings” once they have sufficient evidence of grooming. Several cases have shown that talking to decoys as though they were a real child can be grounds enough for sentencing.

These stings take place in public (where a predator has asked a child to meet him in a park or shopping mall) or at the predator’s home. In the UK alone, over 150 hunting teams were collectively responsible for 1,148 confrontations with suspected paedophiles in 2021. Their evidence helped secure prosecutions in hundreds of cases."

"The most obvious way of defending the consent requirement against Douglas’s challenge appeals to the fact that incarceration merely interferes with the right to free movement, but medical interventions interfere with the right to bodily integrity. This argument rests on what Douglas calls the “robustness claim”—the claim that the right to bodily integrity is more robust than the right to freedom of movement. In other words, the right to freedom of movement loses its protective force in a wider range of circumstances than the right to bodily integrity. Douglas’s article seeks to undermine the robustness claim, by arguing that neither case-based intuitions, nor theoretical considerations support this claim. In this article, I will attempt to raise some doubts about Douglas’s challenge to the consent requirement and the robustness claim."

The most fundamental lie at work is the conflation of sexual orientation and sex, a traditional way of smearing gay people by presenting them as child molesters.

One of the primary indicators that someone will carry out an act of violence is being a victim of one beforehand. The idea that violence spreads between people, reproducing itself and shifting group norms, explains why one area might see fewer stabbings or shootings than another – even if it has many of the same social problems.

"A sexual predator is a person who seeks out sexual contact with another person in a predatory or abusive manner. People who are sexual predators may or may not have committed sex crimes — like sexual harassment, assault, rape, and pedophilia — but all sexual predators have sought out inappropriate contact in one way or another. 

Those who exploit others in a sexual manner may not be just seeking sex. Rather, they see sex as a form of dominance and control."

"There is debate over how best to conceive of the precise purposes of imprisonment in modern society. Four of the key reasons commonly given for imprisoning people
who have offended are:

- to protect the public by removing offenders from communities (incapacitation)
- to punish the offender – delivering retribution in a serious but proportionate way
where a serious crime has been committed
- to serve as a deterrent to the offender and/or to others
- to rehabilitate the offender"

"Neo-conservative Harvard management professor, James Q. Wilson added mans' nature to the equation. In his influential book, Thinking About Crime, Wilson wrote, "It requires not merely optimistic but heroic assumptions about the nature of man to lead one to suppose that a person, finally sentenced after (in most cases) many brushes with the law, and having devoted a good part of his youth and young adulthood to misbehavior of every sort, should, by either the solemnity of prison or the skillfulness of a counselor, come to see the error of his ways and to experience a transformation of his character." And, as Wilson would later conclude, that character was often more "wicked" than errant."

Other rights are described as ‘qualified’. This means they can only be restricted in order to protect the rights of other people or if it’s in the public interest for specific reasons such as the prevention of crime.

Finally, while research on non-GPS electronic monitoring provides important insights about the value of monitoring strategies, the technological differences between passive alert systems (non-GPS and passive GPS19) and an active monitoring system (active GPS) are significant and must be accounted for when assessing the effectiveness of any specific monitoring technique or electronic monitoring strategy as a whole in any research summary."

"Children of sex offenders question their own sexuality and fear that they may have inherited their father's perversions. Intelligent, sensitive young men sit with Keenan and confess that that fear they may have a gene for abusing children. Sons of the man tend to feel such guilt by association, that they may break down, quit their jobs, leave their marriages or break-up with their girlfriends.

The adult siblings of the offender are affected as well. The brothers of convicted paedophiles may resign their jobs, fearing that the family name alone is enough to bring their employers into disrepute.

For the immediate family, the question of whether to continue living with the paedophile, or throw him out, is obviously a major issue. Life for the convicted paedophile isn't easy, nor should it be, but the effects on his family are, in many ways, worse. He cannot find work, he is shunned by the community, he has brought the entire family into disrepute, even though they do not deserve it."

According to these studies, sex offenders have deficiencies in social skills that seriously restrict the possibility of maintaining intimacy. Ward and colleagues (1995) proposed that sex offenders are likely to have difficulty forming attachments with others and will engage in distorted thinking, such as "courting" a child and treating him or her as his lover. Knox (2014) recently found that juveniles who have committed a sexual offense had lower levels of attachment to fathers or father figures than juveniles who have committed a non-sexual offense."

The FUSE model was associated with lower psychiatric inpatient hospitalization days, fewer jail days, dramatic declines in shelter stays, and increased stability in housing (Aidala et al., 2014)."

However, numerous exemptions from the Act apply and the ‘rehabilitation periods’ contained within it have long been considered excessive. Whilst limited reforms were introduced in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, those sentenced to more than four years in prison can still never become legally rehabilitated. Instead, they are cast into a permanent state of civic purgatory where their notional ‘debt to society’ becomes a full-blow ‘moral mortgage’ which can never be paid off."

"Beyond a reasonable doubt is the highest standard of evidence that exists in the judicial systems of common law countries. As the inclusion of the word “reasonable,” however, suggests, proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a person committed a crime does not mean that there is absolutely no doubt about his or her innocence. Rather, the phrase means that the established facts of the case lead the court to only one logical conclusion: that the defendant is guilty of the charges against him or her. Unreasonable doubt can still exist, but by its very nature such doubt does not lead a reasonable person to conclude that the accused did not commit the crime in question. This high standard of proof helps to reduce the likelihood of wrongful convictions."

The team arrived at a deliberately conservative figure that lays bare the extent of possible miscarriages of justice, suggesting that the innocence of more than 200 prisoners still in the system may never be recognised."

The scheme is capped to an amount of £1 million where a person has been detained for at least 10 years, and to £500,000 in all other cases.

Typically, there are no eyewitnesses and physical evidence is found in only 15% of confirmed cases (Kerns, 1981). Even if medical evidence is present, it seldom identifies the specific perpetrator. Therefore, unless a confession is obtained, determination of whether and by whom the sexual abuse was committed rests, in large measure, on the word of the child."

However Thompson, Clarke-Stewart, and Lepore (1997), in their review of previous studies on suggestibility, have pointed out that some of the studies have used rather "extreme" paradigms. These have included multiple interviews during which misinformation is presented in an authoritative and intimidating manner and in interviews in which social pressure is used to convince the child of the adult's knowledge of the ‘false' events. Most often the studies have been carried out on preschool children who are interviewed about a staged event, use a set of suggestions that follow a common theme."

"In conclusion, our findings suggest that response accuracy in young children can be influenced by suggestible question types and repeated questioning. Specifically, 3- to 5-year-olds perform best when faced with positive-leaning questions and struggle most when faced with
negative-leaning questions. Additive-misinformation questions also diminished response accuracy, although not to the extent of negative-leaning questions. When these questions are repeated, response accuracy in children is influenced in several ways. When asked repeated negative-leaning questions, children’s response accuracy improves, such that they are more likely to not agree to a negative leaning question the second time it is asked. At the same time, we found that repeating additive-misinformation questions causes children’s response accuracy to diminish, such that children are more likely to make errors the second time an additive- misinformation question is asked."

"The results revealed that judges virtually never found children incompetent to testify, but children exhibited substantial variability in their performance based on question-type. Definition questions, about the meaning of the truth and lies, were the most difficult largely due to errors in response to “Do you know” questions. Questions about the consequences of lying were more difficult than questions evaluating the morality of lying. Children exhibited high rates of error in response to questions about whether they had ever told a lie. Attorneys rarely asked children hypothetical questions in a form that has been found to facilitate performance. Defense attorneys asked a higher proportion of the more difficult question types than prosecutors. The findings suggest that children’s truth–lie competency is underestimated by courtroom questioning and support growing doubts about the utility of the competency requirements."

At the end of 2001, about 83,000 state prison inmates, or about 6.8 percent, were male sex offenders who had committed a rape or sexual assault against a minor under age 18, according to Allen Beck, chief of corrections statistics for the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics."

"Because policymakers failed to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus in prisons and jails, correctional facilities have topped The New York Times’ list of largest outbreaks for months. Not only did officials do little to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within correctional facilities, but they also did little to prevent the transmission of the virus from prison and jail hotspots to nearby surrounding communities. As a consequence, and as our analyses show, ignoring, downplaying, and distorting this systematic failure left communities exposed."

"Sixty-two percent of formerly incarcerated respondents to a 2020 survey reported that they rarely or never had access to fresh vegetables while incarcerated. The typical prison diet, which is high in salt, sugar, and refined carbohydrates, contributes to the elevated rates of diabetes and heart disease among the incarcerated population. People who are incarcerated in the U.S. are also six times more likely to contract a foodborne illness than the general population."

"Prisoners can earn money in various ways while in prison. Paid purposeful activity is available to many, but not all, prisoners. These activities include education and training, prison services jobs such as cleaning or mentoring, and commercial workshops within prisons. There are also a relatively small number of prisoners who have access to release on temporary licence (ROTL) who are paid by external employers. For those who do not take part in purposeful activity, retirement pay is offered to those who are above the national retirement age and choose not to work, and a base rate of unemployment pay is offered to those who are unable to work in the prison and for unconvicted prisoners who have the right to choose not to work."

"Incarcerated workers in the US produce at least $11bn in goods and services annually but receive just pennies an hour in wages for their prison jobs, according to a new report from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

Nearly two-thirds of all prisoners in the US, which imprisons more of its population than any other country in the world, have jobs in state and federal prisons. That figure amounts to roughly 800,000 people, researchers estimated in the report, which is based on extensive public records requests, questionnaires and interviews with incarcerated workers.

ACLU researchers say the findings outlined in Wednesday’s report raise concerns about the systemic exploitation of prisoners, who are compelled to work sometimes difficult and dangerous jobs without basic labor protections and little or no training while making close to nothing."

These programs can be operated by CDCR employees, other governmental employees, private entities, or nonprofits."

"Importantly, results of this examination showed that treatments for OMI are effective during periods of confinement. Given robust findings that continuity of care has contributed to the improvement of clinical and functional outcomes among the severely mentally ill (Adair et al., 2005; Brekke, Ansel, Long, Slade, & Weinstein, 1999), with those receiving fewer gaps in services having better rehabilitative outcomes (Brekke et al., 1999), findings that interventions are effective during periods of confinement have significant policy implications. Although many stake holders might prefer to delay intensive services until offenders are released from prison (or other correctional setting), it is important to note that significant treatment gains can begin during incarceration. These gains, with concomitant services in the community, are likely to improve the chances of keeping OMI from recidivating (criminally or psychiatrically)."

"But however unpalatable it may be to some, the fact is prisoners are still people, and if we want them to have any respect for society when they get out we need to be mindful of their dignity as fellow human beings.

Many people die in prison. Each year in the UK, six or seven prisoners a month take their own lives, sometimes more. A similar number die of "natural causes". Some are murdered, and some have their deaths categorised as “unexplained". But the vast majority will one day be released and will be somebody’s neighbour. This is not an argument for sympathy or compassion for prisoners, and neither is it an appeal for prisoners’ rights. But so long as any society has a system that lets people out of prison it is in everyone’s interests that they are let out in better shape than they were when they went in."

"Lupron is also expensive. On top of an $800 fee for the monthly dose, which in some cases is covered by MassHealth, treatment requires a daylong assessment by a doctor like Sorrentino or Saleh to determine whether a patient is eligible. Patients must often pay for the balance of the assessment themselves, which can run between $1,500 and $2,500. They are also required to cover the cost of all follow-up tests. Sorrentino’s Lupron patients need constant monitoring: Blood tests, for instance, check their testosterone levels to ensure they’re not secretly taking Viagra to counteract Lupron’s effects."

"Avoidance plays an important role in the perpetuation of pOCD. Individuals suffering with pOCD will do everything in their power to ensure that these fears do not come to fruition. As is the case with all forms of OCD, escape and avoidance maintain and exacerbate the anxiety. In response to an impulsivity fear, one may stand as far away as possible from a minor or escape the situation altogether. Avoiding children at parks, museums, or nearby schools helps to ensure that these thoughts, images, and feelings will not surface. In line with avoidance, some individuals may choose not to have children of their own in order to limit the danger that they feel they pose to children."

More recently, Tjaden and Thoennes (2006) found that only 19 percent of women and 13 percent of men who were raped since their 18th birthday reported the rape to the police. Several studies of victims have shown that the likelihood that a sexual assault will be reported to law enforcement decreases with the victim's age (Kilpatrick, Saunders & Smith, 2003; Sorenson & Snow, 1991)."

"Given the nature of their work, risk management is often on most criminals’ minds. Antar, as well as all of the other ex-cons I have spoken to, proudly told me about their hedging strategies. Yet, when we think of criminals, we usually don’t think of prudent risk takers. This is probably because the decision to commit a crime in the first place is an extremely high-risk choice. Yet people make that choice every day, in large part because the actual probability of getting caught and how people perceive that risk don’t always line up. Every ex-con I have spoken to in my research has said the same thing, “I never thought I’d get caught.”

The decision whether to commit securities fraud is not a decision that most of us face. But we all face risky choices in our lives and, just like the Antars, we often aren’t great at assessing the odds a risk will work out."

"For example, when presented with a statement that informed the participants that the death penalty was an ineffective general deterrent, participants commonly pointed out flaws with the system that could account for this finding (long appeals process, the lack of severity in the treatment of death row inmates, and the failure of the state to sentence more people to death)."

"Even premeditated killers don’t expect to be executed. And for good reason. Statistics show that a homicidal gangster is far more likely to die at the hands of his fellow thugs than the hands of the state. As economist and Freakonomics author Steven Levitt writes, “No rational criminal should be deterred by the death penalty, since the punishment is too distant and too unlikely to merit much attention.”

Well, then, just speed up the appeals process, some say. But the appeals
process has already been shortened as much as possible without being
reckless. This at the same time that a steady stream of DNA exonerations have raised important questions about investigative tactics once thought to be foolproof."

To best reach people worried about their own or someone else’s online sexual behaviour, we work with partner organisations to plan bespoke campaigns to meet the individual needs of the area. Through press engagement, workforce webinars, social media and print advertising, we help adults know what they can do to help keep children safe.

"“The psychological mind-set of the criminal is such that they are not able to consider consequences at the time of the crime. Most crimes are crimes of passion that are done in situations involving intense excitement or concern. People who commit these crimes are not in a normal state of mind — they do not consider the consequences in a logical way,” Groner observed. Deterrents may work in instances where the punishment is obvious and immediate, neither of which are true for the death penalty."

punishment. Indeed, studies suggest that the deterrent effect of certainty is far stronger than
that of severity."

increases, decreases, or has no effect on homicide rates.""
[241] https://www.aclu.org/documents/death-penalty-questions-and-answers
"The death penalty has no deterrent effect. Claims that each execution deters a certain number of murders have been thoroughly discredited by social science research. People commit murders largely in the heat of passion, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or because they are mentally ill, giving little or no thought to the possible consequences of their acts. The few murderers who plan their crimes beforehand — for example, professional executioners — intend and expect to avoid punishment altogether by not getting caught. Some self-destructive individuals may even hope they will be caught and executed.

Using the defence requires defendants to show it was reasonable, given their character, for them to have responded by killing. But there is little definition of what counts as provocation."
[242] https://www.amnestyusa.org/updates/a-clear-scientific-consensus-that-the-death-penalty-does-not-deter/
"The results reveal that most experts do not believe that the death penalty or the carrying out of executions serve as deterrents to murder, nor do they believe that existing empirical research supports the deterrence theory. In fact, the authors report that 88.2% of respondents do not think that the death penalty deters murder—a level of consensus comparable to the agreement among scientists regarding global climate change opens in a new tab. At the same time, only 9.2% of surveyed experts indicated that they believed the death penalty results in a significant drop in murder cases (56.6% completely disagreed with that statement, while 32.9% thought the correlation between capital punishment and lower homicide numbers to be “largely inaccurate”; 1.3% were uncertain)."

"In 2015, for example, an analysis by Swiss researchers looked at 14 studies that compared what happened when criminals were put behind bars to what happened when they were given some other sentence, such as probation or electronic monitoring, that allowed them to stay out of jail or prison. The researchers found that crime rates were just as high for people who’d spent time behind bars as for those who hadn’t.

In 2021, a much larger analysis of 116 studies reached a similar conclusion: Spending time behind bars either didn’t affect a person’s future crime risk or slightly increased it, compared with people who received a sentence that didn’t involve imprisonment. That finding held true for men and women, young people and adults, people who served time in county jails and those housed in state prisons. In no situation did time behind bars reduce a criminal’s risk of future crime, Damon Petrich of the University of Cincinnati reported in the journal Crime & Justice."

If released, an offender serving a life sentence will remain on licence for the rest of their life. If they are ever thought to be a risk to the public they could be recalled to prison.

On average, the sexual offense recidivism rate was low (13.4%; n = 23,393). There were, however, subgroups of offenders who recidivated at high rates. Sexual offense recidivism was best predicted by measures of sexual deviancy (e.g., deviant sexual preferences, prior sexual offenses) and, to a lesser extent, by general criminological factors (e.g., age, total prior offenses). Those offenders who failed to complete treatment were at higher risk for reoffending than those who completed treatment. The predictors of nonsexual violent recidivism and general (any) recidivism were similar to those predictors found among nonsexual criminals (e.g., prior violent offenses, age, juvenile deliquency). Our results suggest that applied risk assessments of sexual offenders should consider separately the offender's risk for sexual and nonsexual recidivism."

Doren’s estimates were largely based on long-term follow-up of highly selected samples (Hanson et al., 1995; Prentky, et al., 1997); in contrast, the current study used larger and more diverse samples, including many low risk offenders serving community sentences. Doren’s (1998) estimates were also based on charges, whereas most of the recidivism data in the current study was based on convictions."

"True pedophiles are those who show persistent and focused sexual attraction to prepubescent children. They show specific arousal to pedophilic stimuli on physiological measures of sexual arousal and have repeated sexual encounters with or recurrent sexual urges toward children. Opportunistic pedophiles have less of a focused sexual attraction to children. Their sexual engagement with children may depend on circumstances, such as the availability of a child victim, disinhibition secondary to substance abuse, or difficulty in connecting with an adult sexual partner.

There is some controversy whether this distinction reflects distinct categories or a continuum. Clearly, it suggests that people who molest children may have distinctly different motivations. For example, true pedophiles may be motivated more by abnormal sexual desire while opportunistic pedophiles may be better characterized by failure to inhibit their impulses."

"The idea behind having the death penalty for such offenders is the belief that it tells pedophiles how heinous their crimes are, and that death is the only way to be sure an offender won't do it again.

"The very serious meaning of this is to send a message to child molesters that it is a bad thing to do," said state Rep. Marcel Black, the chairman of the Alabama House Judiciary Committee."

"Survivors of childhood sexual abuse are 10 to 13 times more likely to attempt suicide. (Plunkett A, O’Toole B, Swanston H, Oates RK, Shrimpton S, Parkinson P 2001)."

"In order to keep the abuse secret, the abuser will often play on the child's fear, embarrassment, or guilt about what is happening, perhaps convincing them that no one will believe them or that the child will be punished. Sometimes the abuser will convince the child that he or she enjoyed it and wanted it to happen."

"Child abuse and neglect can cause disrupted development leading to delays in, deficits of, or failures of multisystem achievements in motor, emotional, behavioral, language, psychosocial, social, and cognitive skills (for review see De Bellis, 2001).

Individuals with child maltreatment histories are more likely to manifest multiple health risk behaviors and serious medical illnesses, have greater rates of psychiatric impairment and medical utilization, higher rates of developmental disorders, impaired attachment, greater risk for violent crimes, substance use disorders, more school discipline problems and suspensions, poor long-term intellectual and academic achievement, and greater likelihood of becoming a teenage parent."

"What the court required was that all prisoners must be given opportunities to improve themselves. It must be clear to them at the time of sentence that there is a review mechanism in place which will in due course consider whether they qualify for release. The court has suggested that such a review should take place after no more than 25 years. This is at the upper end of the average period after which most European countries consider the release of all prisoners serving life sentences. It is also the period after which the international criminal court will review the sentences of offenders sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes such as mass genocide. The European court emphasised that considering release did not mean that the worst offenders could not serve longer, or that dangerous offenders who had committed serious crimes should be released while they posed a risk to society."

"Now there has been countless studies done by the New York Times and NCCP that show that a counter for the death penalty and violent offenses is rehabilitation. Prisons make small time offenders hardened criminals, and the death penalty only creates more social depression and hampers our ability to make a society safe, but rehabilitation puts hardened and small time offenders back on the street as good citizens. Rehabilitation can come in many forms, such as job experience, college tuition and counseling. Right-wing conservatives will have you believe that if free care isn’t provided to normal citizens, then it should not be provided to criminals. They are the ones who need it the most. If we do not give them training and experience, they will come right out of prison and result to the only thing they can do, crime."

"It turns to Rousseau's social contract based justification for punishment as a crucial resource in that effort. It begins by closely examining Rousseau's claim that the criminal consents to punishment, and by suggesting that his seemingly absurd and perverse claims are actually defensible. It goes on to clarify two senses in which Rousseau's understanding of consent serves to ground the rights of the guilty. First, it argues that the idea of consent itself legitimizes some punishment but also sets strict limits on when and how the state can punish. Second, it argues that Rousseau's account of welfare rights also sets a limit on when the state may rightfully punish."

"US policy makers struggle with the tension between protecting personal privacy and enabling law enforcement surveillance. We know that both are important, but at a certain point, prioritizing one priority shortchanges the other. 

If we lock down electronic privacy, then terrorists can plan in secret and drug dealers’ jobs become much easier. Organizing crime or violence simplifies; paying for it stays hidden.

But giving the police free reign impacts privacy and restricts our lives, Think about it. If you believed that the police were watching everything you did – that everything you clicked on and every move you made could be public – you would live more carefully."

"She identifies two different ways of valuing ourselves that are at work in Kant’s arguments, regarding humanity as a valuable property and as the source of normative standing. She argues that we value ourselves as ends both in the sense of attributing normative standing to ourselves and in the sense that we regard our ends as good because they are good for us, a sense which extends to the other animals."

"It was a coping mechanism she learned young, without really understanding why. But now, at 43, she recognises it as a way of fighting the feelings of worthlessness and shame so many child abuse survivors experience. “It was saying: ‘Look at me, I belong here; I can do the same as you, if not better.’”"
