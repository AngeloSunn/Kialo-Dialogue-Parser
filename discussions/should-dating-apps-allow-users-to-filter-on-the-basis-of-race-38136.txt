Discussion Name:
Should dating apps allow users to filter on the basis of race?

1. Thesis:
Dating apps should not allow users to filter on the basis of race.

  1.1. Pro:
  Race is not relevant when it comes to relationships and therefore the filters are unnecessary.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    The number of interracial couples has increased [1] since the advent of online dating because through interacting online, people were able to discover that similarities in interests and values transcended race. Introducing race filters is likely to cut down on this progress.

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      There is no proven causal link between online dating apps and increased interracial relationships. If dating apps can't be proven to impact interracial relationships, the addition of a filter can't be considered to impact interracial relationships.

      1.1.1.2. Pro:
      Interracial couples and marriages are good for society.

        1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
        The introduction of anti-miscegenation laws has historically been linked [2] to some of the world's worst regimes, including apartheid South Africa, Nazi Germany, and North Korea.

        1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
        Studies have [3] found [4] that mixed race people are considered more attractive than members of a single race.

        1.1.1.2.3. Con:
        Children who are born to interracial couples are usually at a disadvantage [5] compared to their counterparts.

          1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          Studies have found that children belonging to interracial couples display greater instances of antisocial behavior​ [6].

            1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
            A study in Seattle found that multiracial children exhibited greater levels of physical violence [7] than monoracial children.

            1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Con:
            There are likely to be factors other than race, such as lack of attention [8] and stressful home environment [9], that lead to the development of antisocial behavior among children.

        1.1.1.2.4. Pro:
        Interracial couples can help reduce racial tensions [10] among communities.

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      Attitudes of bias and discrimination against interracial couples started declining long before online dating [11], and certain factors suggest that they are likely to continue to improve in the future.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        In 2015 [12], 37% of Americans indicated their support and acceptance towards interracial couples, up from 24% in 2011.

        1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
        In 1990 [13], 63% of Americans opposed the idea of a close relative marrying a black person, an attitude which has reduced to 14% by 2016.

        1.1.1.3.3. Pro:
        With more individuals pursuing college education, these attitudes are changing for the better.

          1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
          A majority of those between the ages of 18 and 29 and a bachelor’s degree​ [14] highly support interracial relationships.

        1.1.1.3.4. Con:
        Reducing bias and discrimination does not suggest this has gone away entirely. It is legitimate for individuals to take active steps to avoid this discrimination, including restricting their dating pool based on race.

    1.1.2. Con:
    Race can be an indicator of cultural preferences, which are important in a relationship.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      Cultural preferences are more strongly influenced by values, language, and shared experiences than race.

        1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
        Musical preferences are determined by [15] value and comprehensibility as opposed to race.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        Race is often a strong determinant [16] of certain experiences that other races do not share.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      In America, different racial groups have different television show preferences [17].

      1.1.2.3. Pro:
      Race can be an indicator [18] of one's religion, which can be important if you want to raise children in a religious household.

        1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
        Several [19] dating [20] sites [21] exist exclusively for members of a specific religion.

        1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
        Race and religion can play an important role in national identity in countries like Israel [22].

          1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
          In 2015, only 23 out of 58,000 marriages [23] were between Arabs and Jews in Israel.

        1.1.2.3.3. Con:
        Filtering by religion would achieve this goal without introducing racial bias.

        1.1.2.3.4. Con:
        The proportion of people who consider religion as important is declining around the world.

          1.1.2.3.4.1. Pro:
          In the US, the percentage of adults who identify with Protestantism has declined from 51% in 2009 to 43% in 2019 [24].

    1.1.3. Pro:
    It is entirely possible for people of all races to have positive interracial relationships.

      1.1.3.1. Con:
      Studies argue [25] that the stigma surrounding interracial relationships can have negative consequences with regards to individual mental health and functioning of a relationship.

        1.1.3.1.1. Con:
        This is a problem that stems from people's prejudices regarding interracial relationships, and does not show that interracial couples can't have positive relationships.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      A 2006 investigation [26] into relationship satisfaction between interracial couples versus intraracial couples found that there was no difference in one study and that in the other, interracial couples reported more satisfaction in their relationships.

      1.1.3.3. Pro:
      In 2018 it was reported that interracial couples make up one in ten marriages [27] in the United States.

      1.1.3.4. Con:
      Interracial relationships typically last for a shorter duration compared to same-race relationships (p. 6 [28]).

        1.1.3.4.1. Pro:
        The relationships of interracial couples are 1.4 years shorter on average than their intraracial counterparts (p. 11 [29]).

      1.1.3.5. Con:
      It is entirely possible for people of all races to have negative interracial relationships.

    1.1.4. Con:
    Dating and romantic relationships are deeply personal and we cannot assume or determine what is relevant for others when it comes to this.

      1.1.4.1. Con:
      Removing racial filters does not determine who one chooses as a partner. It merely presents more potential partners to the app's user.

    1.1.5. Pro:
    There are factors other than race that make a relationship meaningful and sustainable.

      1.1.5.1. Pro:
      A healthy relationship for many people is based on mutual respect [30].

      1.1.5.2. Con:
      While other factors may also be an important part of having a meaningful relationship, race can still be a relevant factor that individuals want to consider when choosing a partner.

      1.1.5.3. Pro:
      John Gottman, a relationships and couples researcher, says that the ability to trust [31] one another is crucial to relationships.

      1.1.5.4. Con:
      Sustainable relationships also depend largely on the attitude and acceptance of one's partner by their family members [32] (p. 6). Interracial relationships are, in many instances, not accepted by family members.

        1.1.5.4.1. Pro:
        Individuals in these relationships are more likely to develop stress and anxiety [33] as a result of such attitudes.

        1.1.5.4.2. Con:
        Even though family members might be unaccepting of the relationship in its initial stages, they are more likely to change their attitudes overtime (p. 29 [34]).

    1.1.6. Con:
    The science behind race based attraction is real and legitimate so individuals should be able to filter for this the way they do with other characteristics.

      1.1.6.1. Pro:
      A study [35] found that people on dating apps have strong racial preferences.

      1.1.6.2. Con:
      People who only want to date members of the same race are still free to do so. But filtering for race implies that an individual doesn't even want to look at the pictures of other races, which is racist.

        1.1.6.2.1. Pro:
        One study found that racially discriminatory dating beliefs were tied to higher levels of racial bigotry [36] in general.

        1.1.6.2.2. Con:
        If you know that you are not interested in dates with certain attributes, whether these are age, skin or eye color, showing them to you will just annoy you as it's wasting your time.

        1.1.6.2.3. Con:
        This would be true if there were a race filter on Instagram photos, where you could decide you don't want to see photos that include people of a certain race. But dating apps have a different purpose than "looking at pictures", their purpose is for you to efficiently find dates. If you are not interested in people with certain attributes that does not mean that you don't want to look at photos of people including these, but that you are not interested in dating them.

      1.1.6.3. Pro:
      There are certain genetic components that are out of our control that influence [37] who we find attractive.

        1.1.6.3.1. Con:
        One study found [38] that there is no strong attractiveness bias in favor of individuals of the same race.

        1.1.6.3.2. Pro:
        Genetics play a role in how height [39] affects an individual's attractiveness.

        1.1.6.3.3. Pro:
        One study found [40] that phenotypic prototypicality (PP) can affect perceptions of attractiveness towards Asians.

        1.1.6.3.4. Pro:
        One study found [41] that the major histocompatibility complex "correlates with partnership, sexuality and enhances the desire to procreate."

        1.1.6.3.5. Con:
        It is unlikely [42] that we have evolved any genetic or psychological adaptations relating to race because our ancestors were rarely able to interact with individuals from other races as they did not travel too far from their birthplaces.

        1.1.6.3.6. Con:
        Given that race is a social construct [43] and not a biological reality, genes should not influence whether or not people are attracted to a particular race.

          1.1.6.3.6.1. Pro:
          "All human beings are 99.9 percent identical [44] in their genetic makeup."

        1.1.6.3.7. Pro:
        One study [45] found that people are more likely to be attracted to and choose a partner to whom they are more genetically similar.

          1.1.6.3.7.1. Con:
          If all humans are almost entirely genetically similar, they should be attracted to everyone despite of their race.

            1.1.6.3.7.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.6.3.6.1.

      1.1.6.4. Con:
      There is no definitive study that confirms that attraction to certain races is determined by science and not cultural stereotypes.

        1.1.6.4.1. Con:
        Not every romantic/sexual preference is about the personality. Some people go as far as to say "I want my ideal partner's eye width to be no less than 2cm" and refuse to date anyone who looks otherwise. For the same reason, whoever filters out a specific race might not be because of cultural stereotypes but simply distaste in the skin color or facial looks in general.

      1.1.6.5. Pro:
      While Bumble [46] does not have a racial filter, it does allow users to filter people based on height, star sign, or education, among others.

        1.1.6.5.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.6.3.2.

        1.1.6.5.2. Con:
        There is no legitimate science to back up the relevance of one's star sign to their personality or attractiveness.

          1.1.6.5.2.1. Con:
          -> See discussion #8911: Astrology is a valid practice.

    1.1.7. Con:
    Sharing a similar race can help partners within a relationship understand each other better.

      1.1.7.1. Pro:
      Interracial couples might find it difficult to understand why their partner is affected by a certain incident relevant to their race.

        1.1.7.1.1. Con:
        People of different genders may also be affected or impacted by particular incidents relevant to their genders, but this does not stop people having successful relationships with people of different genders to them.

        1.1.7.1.2. Pro:
        Police brutality disproportionately targets [47] blacks, and black partners would find it difficult to discuss [48] these matters with their white counterparts.

      1.1.7.2. Con:
      A better understanding with one's partner can easily be developed if both people are open in their communication [49] with each other.

    1.1.8. Con:
    Race filters might be useful to have in the same way that, if you aren't attracted to women, you should be allowed to skip them, instead of seeing the picture and saying, "No, I'm not interested" every time.

    1.1.9. Pro:
    Other filters in dating apps, like age and religion, at least tell something about a person that is important for compatibility. Race doesn't tell anything about a person except their ancestry.

    1.1.10. Con:
    Dating and relationships are not equivalent. Dating is the first phase of a relationship and is based almost entirely on physical attraction. Dating apps focus on that phase.

      1.1.10.1. Con:
      Many may be unaware that they physically attracted to members of others races. Using race filters prevents them from gaining such knowledge about themselves.

      1.1.10.2. Con:
      On dating apps like Tinder, swiping actions are less influenced by facial attractiveness and more by other factors like moral character [50].

  1.2. Pro:
  It is unethical to allow people to filter other individuals on the basis of race.

    1.2.1. Con:
    Utilitarianism [51] is a branch of ethics that promotes actions that maximise happiness. If filtering on the basis of race allows people to make dating decisions that bring them a great deal of happiness, it would not be seen as unethical to let them do this.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Filtering potential partners based on race reduces the number of possible matches, thereby reducing the chance of finding the perfect partner and maximizing one's happiness.

        1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
        Having racial preferences could also reduce your chances of finding a partner of the desired race, as individuals in that group may perceive you as racist.

          1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          One study found [52] that "disclosing racial preferences in the domain of attraction is interpreted as reflecting racism, even by those who ostensibly believe that people can have non-racist racial preferences."

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      If an individual wants to find a partner of a specific race, then they will waste time scrolling through all the other races if there is no filter, rather than maximizing their effort to find only those they are looking for.

        1.2.1.2.1. Con:
        It only takes, on average [53], 3-6 seconds for people to swipe left or right on Tinder. This is not a major time investment.

    1.2.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.6.2.

    1.2.3. Pro:
    It is unethical to promote the idea that it is natural to have preferences for individuals of some races over others, in any area of your life. Racial filters normalise this.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      Giving users on dating apps the ability to filter individuals on the basis of race gives validation to the idea that there are fundamental differences between people of different races and can therefore indirectly also validate stereotypes or preconceived notions about particular races.

        1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
        There are no significant genetic differences between races. Rather, race is a label with no scientific basis. [54]

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        Using filters may not necessarily lead to the validation of stereotypical notions of race.

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      It is unethical to call something unethical just because you disagree with it.

      1.2.3.3. Con:
      Racial filters are an option; you don't have to use it.

      1.2.3.4. Con:
      By the same logic, dating apps promote the unethical idea that it is natural to have preferences for individuals of a certain gender. Yet we do not generally criticize these apps for that.

    1.2.4. Con:
    While it is unethical to segregate people on the basis of race, filtering for a personal preference is not unethical.

      1.2.4.1. Con:
      Filtering for race is the modern day equivalent of segregation because it effectively separates races into potentially unequal dating pools.

        1.2.4.1.1. Con:
        Race-specific dating apps are even more exclusionary than race based filters.

          1.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
          Unlike dating apps that use race based filters, race-specific dating apps do not [55] promise an inclusive experience for all users, but rather flag that they are specifically designed for a niche community.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        Due to race-based economic [56] imbalances [57] in many countries, filtering for race may increase or reduce your chances of finding an economically successful partner, thus perpetuating these disparities.

        1.2.4.1.3. Con:
        Dating apps are not the only way to find a partner, nor is anyone forced to use them. People can still meet and date members of other races outside dating apps.

          1.2.4.1.3.1. Con:
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is almost impossible to meet people in normal social situations, so online dating [58] will likely become increasingly necessary to find a partner.

            1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Pro:
            Finding a partner can be beneficial [59] for one's mental health during quarantine, so these dating apps play an important role.

          1.2.4.1.3.2. Con:
          People who are not very social otherwise might have no other platforms to revert to, and are thus likely to stick with using the app.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.6.

    1.2.5. Con:
    Businesses are tools [60] that cannot have any moral or social responsibilities.

      1.2.5.1. Con:
      Businesses may not have responsibilities but their owners and shareholders, who are individuals with moral and social responsibilities to their customers and fellow citizens, do.

        1.2.5.1.1. Con:
        The owners and shareholders of businesses have no responsibility or liability, as businesses are considered a separate legal entity [61] (businesses have their own rights and obligations).

      1.2.5.2. Con:
      Corporate Social Responsibility [62] plays an increasingly important role in a company's image and marketability.

        1.2.5.2.1. Pro:
        One study found [63] that 64% of consumers buy products based on a brand's stance on political issues.

        1.2.5.2.2. Con:
        Many companies attempt to appear like they care about social issues, when in reality they are only engaged in brand activism [64].

        1.2.5.2.3. Pro:
        Businesses that are not socially responsible [65] are often boycotted by its consumers.

      1.2.5.3. Pro:
      Dating apps are businesses that are profit-motivated [66], and thus should not be required to take steps that undermine their profitability.

    1.2.6. Pro:
    Allowing white people to filter out all non-white people on dating apps is a form of 'white washing' meaning they are more easily able to pretend that other races do not exist.

      1.2.6.1. Con:
      It is not only white people who want to filter matches on the basis of race.

        1.2.6.1.1. Pro:
        Match, a company which owns Hinge and other dating apps, have said that they have been asked to create filters [67] as otherwise members of minorities cannot find one another.

          1.2.6.1.1.1. Con:
          Members of minorities who want to find each other can oftentimes rely on specific dating apps, for example for Black Americans [68], Native Americans [69], or Indians in the US [70].

      1.2.6.2. Con:
      It is claimed that there is a trend of increasing numbers of interracial relationships [71]. This may suggest that white people, being the largest demographic, are generally and increasingly open to relationships with non-whites. Therefore fears of whitewashing in dating apps may be unfounded.

      1.2.6.3. Pro:
      A dating app user group is a representative sample of the community. A racist person may use the filter to create an artificial illusion of a community which confirms their racial bias. This may re-enforce and/or prevent challenge to their racial bias.

        1.2.6.3.1. Con:
        We use many things that could be misused (e.g., guns, cars, planes), but restricting access to these would make life more inconvenient.

      1.2.6.4. Con:
      Some people are attracted to people of other races; therefore, they may use filters to exclude members of their own race. Non-White people can just as easily use race filters to filter out White people.

      1.2.6.5. Con:
      The individual, private use of a filter can not be equated to whitewashing. Whitewashing normally implies deliberate, systematic, cooperation of many individuals to remove people of non-white races from view. For filtering to be equated to whitewashing would also require that all other possible reasons to use a filter be ignored as possibilities, a form of argument from ignorance.

      1.2.6.6. Con:
      There is no evidence that allowing white people to filter results in white people actually using that filter, or that they will exclusively filter out non-white people.

    1.2.7. Con:
    It is not unethical to allow people to filter other individuals on the basis of appearance, character, intelligence. If you want your partner to have a certain quality or characteristic, that does not mean you are unethically discriminating against people of a certain appearance, character or intelligence. Just because you are attracted to women but not men and filter accordingly does not mean you are sexist, for example.

  1.3. Con:
  Individuals may only want to date people of specific races and this is a legitimate choice to make.

    1.3.1. Con:
    People who only wish to date people of the same race should use race-specific dating apps [72].

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      -> See 1.2.4.1.1.

      1.3.1.2. Con:
      Race-specific dating apps are much smaller [73] than the apps that are open for everyone.

    1.3.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.2.

    1.3.3. Pro:
    Interracial couples face bias and discrimination. This makes it legitimate to want to be with someone of the same race.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      A 2016 study [74] found that interracial couples "elicit disgust and are dehumanized relative to same-race couples".

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      Interracial couples in the US say they face discrimination and hostility [75] from other Americans.

      1.3.3.3. Con:
      This bias and discrimination will not be undermined if people only engage in intraracial relationships. Therefore this is not a good reason to avoid interracial relationships.

      1.3.3.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.5.4.

      1.3.3.5. Con:
      -> See 1.1.1.3.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    People of colour and individuals from non-majority races may wish to only date people of the same race as them to avoid experiences of racism and fetishisation while dating.

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      The fetishization of Asian women on dating sites can be very harmful to these women.

        1.3.4.1.1. Pro:
        Such fetishization can lead to higher instances of violence against Asian women when they do not fit the stereotypes.

          1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro:
          In the US, around 61% [76] of Asian women experience physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner during their lifetime.

        1.3.4.1.2. Pro:
        Asian women might be pressured into starving so that they can maintain a "petite figure [77]" that is fetishized on online dating sites.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      Black women are fetishised [78] based on problematic stereotypes surrounding them being sexually dominant and promiscuous.

        1.3.4.2.1. Pro:
        Many people want to date black women because of the perception that they are "aggressive in bed [79]". This is dehumanizing for black women who might feel that they are perceived as only good for one thing.

        1.3.4.2.2. Pro:
        It has been argued that the fetishisation of black women contributed to the exploitation of and violence against black women today, as they are seen as 'legitimate victims' (p. 6 [80]).

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      -> See 1.2.6.1.1.

      1.3.4.4. Pro:
      If a person does not understand the struggles and realities of belonging to a minority group, it is unlikely that they will be able to develop a long-lasting relationship with a person from a minority group.

      1.3.4.5. Con:
      The fact that the 2020 race protests are criticizing [81] the existence of racial filters on these apps means that the potential benefits that these filters may have for people from non-majority races pale in comparison to the harms.

      1.3.4.6. Con:
      A filter based on race will not discriminate between racist people and non-racist people. To filter by race will not only remove the negative interactions but also the potential for good interactions.

      1.3.4.7. Con:
      An analysis of online dating platforms indicates that white people are "ten times less likely to contact [82]" black people than vice versa.

    1.3.5. Con:
    Choices that hurt the dignity of other people are not legitimate.

      1.3.5.1. Con:
      Age-based filters may hurt the dignity of some, but it is largely considered legitimate when searching for a partner.

        1.3.5.1.1. Pro:
        If a 20 year old man wants to find a partner to have children with, it is legitimate to exclude a 50 year old woman as a potential partner, regardless of whether or not the woman's dignity is hurt.

        1.3.5.1.2. Con:
        Age-based filters do not hurt people's dignity in the same way, since people have not been systematically disadvantaged or discriminated against based on this factor.

          1.3.5.1.2.1. Con:
          Ageism [83] is a real and common form of discrimination.

            1.3.5.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            Ageism discriminates against women more than men in the heterosexual dating world, as some women continue to search for older male partners in what is known as the "George Clooney Effect [84]".

            1.3.5.1.2.1.2. Con:
            For many older people, dating apps [85] are the only way for them to get dates.

      1.3.5.2. Pro:
      Being de-preferenced based on one's race might make them feel discriminated against, which could negatively impact their mental health [86].

        1.3.5.2.1. Pro:
        Racial minorities in the US already suffer disproportionately from poor mental health [87]. Making them feel discriminated against on dating apps might worsen this problem.

          1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro:
          Asian-Americans report higher levels of self-stigma [88] (with respect to feeling inferior to others) compared to their white counterparts. Their self-worth is likely to be further affected by such filters.

          1.3.5.2.1.2. Pro:
          The rate of mental health problems of American Indians is disproportionately higher [89] than that of the general US population.

        1.3.5.2.2. Con:
        People are not aware of who has or has not used the race-filter. This makes the possibility of any negative impact on that front less likely.

          1.3.5.2.2.1. Con:
          Even though they are not aware of who has, or has not used the filter, the existence of such filters are usually enough to invoke feelings of discrimination.

          1.3.5.2.2.2. Con:
          If a person is receiving very few matches on a dating app, they may begin to suspect that a lot of people are using race-filters to filter them out.

            1.3.5.2.2.2.1. Con:
            There are many [90] reasons [91] why a person may receive few matches on a dating app.

      1.3.5.3. Pro:
      Racial filters send a message that people are not worthy of being chosen based on their physical or social qualities, which somehow makes them unlovable and unwanted in the eyes of others.

        1.3.5.3.1. Con:
        Nobody is universally desirable. The point of dating apps is not to be loved by everyone, but to find the right person for you.

          1.3.5.3.1.1. Pro:
          Millions of people get rejected [92] on Tinder everyday, even with relatively few filters.

            1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Pro:
            Even for those who find matches, there is a low probability [93] of actually going on a date.

          1.3.5.3.1.2. Con:
          Using a racial filter may stop a person from finding the right person based on preconceived ideas about who their ideal partner would be.

          1.3.5.3.1.3. Con:
          The notion of desirability is falsely contructed [94] through the portrayal of different races by the media. This hinders people's perceptions about who is likely to be the right person for them.

        1.3.5.3.2. Pro:
        For individuals who already battle with low self-esteem, such messages could be harmful [95].

          1.3.5.3.2.1. Pro:
          Studies show [96] that those who battle with low self-esteem are more prone to depression.

        1.3.5.3.3. Pro:
        All filters for race, height, age, gender, or other physical qualities are, by their nature, exclusionary and are therefore potentially harmful and should be removed.

          1.3.5.3.3.1. Pro:
          This is the only way for individuals to be exposed to different types of people, cultures, and ideas, which has several [97] benefits [98] for society.

          1.3.5.3.3.2. Con:
          This would make it harder for dating apps to achieve their purpose of finding the best possible partner for an individual.

      1.3.5.4. Con:
      The reasoning of many people who choose to date members of a different race can also affect the dignity of those who belong to that race.

        1.3.5.4.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.4.2.1.

      1.3.5.5. Con:
      Perceived slights to others' dignity should never delegitimise one's right not to have to date anyone they don't want to.

        1.3.5.5.1. Pro:
        No person is owed a relationship; choosing to not date someone is not a violation of the other person's rights and is thus a legitimate choice.

          1.3.5.5.1.1. Con:
          Even though no person is owed a relationship, everyone is owed equal treatment and equality [99].

      1.3.5.6. Con:
      A racist person can be dignified [100] in their beliefs just as much as a non-racist, and it would be 'legitimate' to disrupt that dignity with choices that disagree with their racist beliefs. There is no self-evident right to have your dignity protected and an individual's dignity has no relevance on the legitimacy or validity of the choices others make.

  1.4. Con:
  -> See 1.1.6.

  1.5. Pro:
  Racial filters on dating apps reinforce racial bias and discrimination.

    1.5.1. Con:
    Racial filters are reflective [101] of racial bias and discrimination that already exists in society. Racial filters do not make this racial bias worse.

      1.5.1.1. Pro:
      People who use racial filters likely do so as a result of preconceived notions and prejudices that they internalized long before they started using the dating app.

      1.5.1.2. Con:
      Racial filters create new biases [102] and strengthen old ones.

        1.5.1.2.1. Pro:
        Men who are active [103] on dating apps regard multiculturalism less favourably and consider sexual racism more acceptable than those who are not active on dating apps.

      1.5.1.3. Pro:
      Many people are on the receiving end of general racist attitudes pertaining to their heritage that are not immediately evident from their images.

        1.5.1.3.1. Pro:
        Indigenous Australians are often abused [104] after the initial interaction when they reveal their ethnicity.

      1.5.1.4. Pro:
      Unless people start to educate themselves on and fight against their own racial biases, no amount of restrictions will cause them to meaningfully change their behaviour.

        1.5.1.4.1. Pro:
        When people are restricted by apps from explicitly flagging their racial preferences, they use alternate phrases [105] to do so that they can avoid detection and continue to engage in their problematic behaviour.

      1.5.1.5. Pro:
      The racial biases on dating apps are reflective [106] of the biases perpetuated by TV and film.

        1.5.1.5.1. Pro:
        In film and television, black women are stereotyped as being more masculine [107] than women of other races, which might not be the preference of many users. In reality, this might not be the case.

    1.5.2. Pro:
    Racial filters embolden users, who are then more likely to express their racism.

      1.5.2.1. Pro:
      The use of filters encourages [108] the belief that expressing sexual interest or disinterest on the basis of race is both natural and appropriate.

      1.5.2.2. Con:
      Dating apps usually have a set of guidelines that restrict racist language and behavior. Users can be banned [109] if they engage in such behaviour.

      1.5.2.3. Pro:
      Voicing offensive opinions does not have the same consequences online as it would in real life, making people more likely to voice them.

        1.5.2.3.1. Pro:
        There are a number of social conventions [110] that restrict how and what we talk to people about in real life. Online, these natural constraints and empathy feature much less prominently.

        1.5.2.3.2. Con:
        People who voice racist opinions in real life are likely to be shut or called out by their friends. The same happens online, where mutual friends on social media platforms distance themselves from those who voice offensive opinions.

          1.5.2.3.2.1. Con:
          This does not apply to dating apps, where your messages are not viewed by friends but are rather sent directly to individuals.

        1.5.2.3.3. Con:
        Using a filter on a search is not equivalent to voicing one's opinion.

        1.5.2.3.4. Pro:
        It has been argued that the "disinhibition effect [111]" encourages unacceptable social behaviour when individuals are physically separated, as the physical barrier stops them from empathising with others.

        1.5.2.3.5. Con:
        If filters are not used and people are messaged by members of other races, it is more likely that they will voice their offensive opinions.

      1.5.2.4. Con:
      People are unlikely to express racism frequently because it diminishes the favourable impression they might have on other users.

        1.5.2.4.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.1.1.1.1.

        1.5.2.4.2. Con:
        If someone is not interested in individuals from another race, they will not be concerned with making a favourable impression on these users.

      1.5.2.5. Con:
      Racial filters make it easier for people with racist views to filter out individuals of other races, so at the very least they are less likely to express their racism towards those people.

      1.5.2.6. Con:
      If you have strong racial preferences and are continuously shown potential dates that don't match these, you will become annoyed with the app and this may result in people expressing more racial bias due to being frustrated about the lack of a filter.

    1.5.3. Pro:
    Racial filters prevent people from forming friendships with members of different races, which is one of the best ways to reduce [112] implicit racism.

      1.5.3.1. Con:
      People do not use [113] dating apps to make friends.

        1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
        If people want to make friends, it seems more logical to use friendship apps [114] where people sign up for the same purpose, i.e. making friends.

      1.5.3.2. Pro:
      It is likely that people might find users on dating apps who they are not sexually attracted to, but find decent enough to be friends with.

        1.5.3.2.1. Pro:
        Dating profiles often include personal details like one's favorite music and interests. Seeing people of other races with similar preferences can help individuals connect on these levels.

        1.5.3.2.2. Con:
        A user who attempted to use dating apps to find friends found that their search for platonic friends always ended in failure [115].

      1.5.3.3. Con:
      People who are likely to use racial filters to filter out people of different races are not likely to talk to those members of different races, even without racial filters. Therefore, friendships are very unlikely to form.

        1.5.3.3.1. Pro:
        Even if friendships do form, they are likely to be weaker [116] friendships, which reduces the likelihood of meaningful and perspective-shifting conversations and interactions among people of different races (p. 571).

      1.5.3.4. Pro:
      Interacting with people from different races can improve [117] the attitudes of individuals towards other races (p. 558).

        1.5.3.4.1. Pro:
        Having friends from different races can help people be more [118] open-minded and accepting of people from different races and cultures.

      1.5.3.5. Pro:
      Dates sometimes become long-term friends.

    1.5.4. Pro:
    Racial bias is rife [119] in online dating.

      1.5.4.1. Pro:
      A study found that in Australia, 96% [120] of users had viewed at least one profile that included some sort of racial discrimination.

      1.5.4.2. Pro:
      Asian men reportedly experience [121] fewer matches on dating sites due to negative stereotypes.

      1.5.4.3. Con:
      There is less racial bias in online dating than in real life. Research [122] has shown that people on online dating forums are more open to interacting with and forming long and lasting relationships with people from different races.

        1.5.4.3.1. Pro:
        According to one report [123]: "74% of Tinder users had gone on a date with someone of a different racial background – as compared with 66% of non-Tinder users."

      1.5.4.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.3.4.7.

    1.5.5. Con:
    Removing the ability to filter based on race in dating apps is unlikely to do anything to undermine racial bias and discrimination.

      1.5.5.1. Pro:
      Many people add details to their profile explicitly outlining [124] their racial preferences and non-preferences, so removing the filter will not make a meaningful difference.

      1.5.5.2. Pro:
      Dating apps reinforce racial biases and discrimination even without racial filters.

        1.5.5.2.1. Pro:
        The algorithm on dating apps already filters [125] and matches people with the type of people they have indicated a preference for (through, say, past successful matches). Even if people were unable to apply filters, the app itself would limit their matches in this way.

          1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro:
          In 2016 [126], it was found that the dating app CoffeeMeetsBagel suggested its users only partners of the same race, even when they said that they had no preference.

        1.5.5.2.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.5.5.2.1.1.

        1.5.5.2.3. Pro:
        People can make statements in their dating app bios, such as 'No Asians' or 'No black people' which makes their racial biases very clear and suggests these are okay preferences.

          1.5.5.2.3.1. Pro:
          Today, more than one in eight [127] individuals include text such as 'No Asians' or 'No black people' in their dating app bios.

        1.5.5.2.4. Con:
        Dating apps have made active efforts to undermine sexual racism and discrimination.

          1.5.5.2.4.1. Pro:
          Grindr launched their "Kindr" initiative [128] to encourage better behaviour on the app and make it clear that they would not tolerate toxic or discriminatory behaviour.

          1.5.5.2.4.2. Pro:
          OKCupid has experimented [129] pairing up users whose profiles were not compatible using the power of suggestion with great success. This could also be used to encourage people to interact with those from different races.

          1.5.5.2.4.3. Con:
          These efforts have not gone far enough to actually stop sexual racism and discrimination on dating apps.

            1.5.5.2.4.3.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.5.4.

            1.5.5.2.4.3.2. Pro:
            -> See 1.5.1.4.1.

          1.5.5.2.4.4. Con:
          Many popular dating apps have still not taken active steps to undermine sexual racism and discrimination.

            1.5.5.2.4.4.1. Pro:
            Hinge [130], a dating app which boasts about 1.2 million users [131] in the US as of 2019, has refused to remove [132] its racial filter.

            1.5.5.2.4.4.2. Pro:
            eHarmony [133], a dating app with 10 million active users [134], continues to boast about its "lifestyle dating" options [135] that filters matches based on race.

            1.5.5.2.4.4.3. Con:
            -> See 1.2.5.3.

          1.5.5.2.4.5. Con:
          Most of these efforts have not been made in good faith - rather they have been in response to [136] the BLM Movement and the increased criticism faced by these apps.

            1.5.5.2.4.5.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.2.5.2.2.

            1.5.5.2.4.5.2. Con:
            The motivation for these changes is not important. If anything, this demonstrates that these apps respond to pressure and criticism.

          1.5.5.2.4.6. Pro:
          Many dating apps no longer allow users to mention their race on their profile.

            1.5.5.2.4.6.1. Pro:
            The app 9Monsters lets users describe themselves without mentioning [137] their race.

            1.5.5.2.4.6.2. Pro:
            The dating app Hornet does not [138] allow users to mention race or racial preference on their profile.

            1.5.5.2.4.6.3. Con:
            In many cases, an individual's race will be made apparent by their pictures.

        1.5.5.2.5. Con:
        Getting rid of racial filters can be a good way to respond to racial biases and discrimination on dating apps even if those ideas are reinforced in other ways.

      1.5.5.3. Pro:
      Even without filters, individuals can choose not to match with or speak to people of different races, meaning any predispositions or biases they have are not undermined in any way.

        1.5.5.3.1. Con:
        Just seeing and especially reading profiles from the 'unwanted' people may break prejudices, also in a purely sub-conscious way.

          1.5.5.3.1.1. Con:
          Our attention spans are shortening due to online platform [139]s. Given this trend, it is unlikely a person with prejudice will apply attention in objectively perusing unwanted profiles sufficient to affect their prejudice

            1.5.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Dating apps have become increasingly gamified [140]. This might counteract the shortening of attention spans caused by online platform use, as users are incentivized to continue using the app.

      1.5.5.4. Con:
      According to Ann Morning, a professor who researches racial classifications, removing race filters at least means users are forced to look at individuals [141] and make decisions that way, rather than being able to eliminate entire races.

      1.5.5.5. Con:
      Removing these filters sends an important signal that excluding entire races from your potential pool is not simply a preference, but is a way or marginalising and discriminating against minorities.

    1.5.6. Con:
    It is not the responsibility of dating apps to fight against racism.

      1.5.6.1. Con:
      Dating apps rely on users [142] to sustain themselves and turn any profits. They thus have a responsibility to work for the best interests of their customers.

      1.5.6.2. Pro:
      The only purpose of dating apps is to help people connect with other people that they find interesting.

        1.5.6.2.1. Con:
        Dating apps must also provide their users with a positive and safe experience. Racial filters will facilitate this.

          1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro:
          Interracial dating often results [143] in uncomfortable experiences in real life, usually for the person from a minority group.

      1.5.6.3. Pro:
      -> See 1.2.5.

    1.5.7. Pro:
    Racial filters result in sexual racism, which is defined [144] as the "sexual rejection of the racial minority".

      1.5.7.1. Pro:
      Sexual racism limits [145] the options for gay and bisexual men of colour to find partners (p. 2751).

        1.5.7.1.1. Con:
        People have no right to be found attractive. The limit is established by the potential partner and their right to choose.

      1.5.7.2. Pro:
      This sexual racism may make it harder for individuals of certain races to find romantic partners and access the benefits of having intimate relationships.

        1.5.7.2.1. Pro:
        Being intimate with someone regularly can benefit your health, including boosting your immune system. [146]

        1.5.7.2.2. Pro:
        A Harvard study that tracked men over 80 years of life concluded that having close relationships impacts people’s health and happiness [147]. They found that these relationships also help delay mental and physical decline.

        1.5.7.2.3. Con:
        People can have close relationships that don’t involve sex or romance. Healthy relationships with family members and friends may well have the same impacts.

        1.5.7.2.4. Con:
        Filters can also increase the chances of having a date, because wanting to have an "exotic" partner involves targeting that specific demographic.

      1.5.7.3. Con:
      All dating involves some form of rejection and acting on preferences in order to find a compatible partner. A preference regarding race does not necessarily come from a racist place.

        1.5.7.3.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.6.3.

        1.5.7.3.2. Pro:
        While it would be racist to not date people of other races on the basis you believe your race to be superior, choosing not to date someone of another race because you do not find yourself sexually attracted to them is not necessarily racist.

        1.5.7.3.3. Con:
        Sexual racism has been shown [148] to be linked to and associated with generic racist attitudes.

      1.5.7.4. Con:
      There are plenty of people [149] belonging to the racial majority who are interested in dates belonging to racial minorities.

      1.5.7.5. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.7.3.3.

    1.5.8. Con:
    Racial filters might help users evade negative experiences on the app.

      1.5.8.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.6.2.1.1.

      1.5.8.2. Con:
      Apps can develop feedback systems for user profiles so that any negative experiences can be reported.

        1.5.8.2.1. Con:
        These feedback systems might be evaluated by individuals who share these biases.

      1.5.8.3. Con:
      Racial filters can also be used to help people fetishise individuals of another race, by allowing them to filter exclusively for those people.

        1.5.8.3.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.4.

      1.5.8.4. Pro:
      Racial filters prevent negative interactions with potentially racist users of the app.

      1.5.8.5. Pro:
      Many users frequently receive uncomfortable comments [150] on their race by other users on the app and thus should have the option to avoid such an experience.

        1.5.8.5.1. Pro:
        Latinos being referred to as 'spicy' or blacks being referred to as 'exotic' might not be welcomed [151] by many users on dating apps.

  1.6. Con:
  People have many personal preferences when it comes to dating and having filters simplifies this.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    Philosopher Lee McIntyre argues [152] that we judge people based on visible characteristics when we meet them in person already, so being able to do so on a dating app is really no different.

    1.6.2. Con:
    Personal preferences could be based on a lack of interaction with people of different races, so removing filters would open us up to new experiences.

      1.6.2.1. Pro:
      When users on dating apps are messaged by people of other races, interracial exchange becomes more likely. [153] This makes it easier for people to overcome their biases by getting to know individuals from another race.

      1.6.2.2. Con:
      -> See 1.5.5.3.

    1.6.3. Pro:
    Filters are the best way for people to find the most compatible partners.

      1.6.3.1. Pro:
      It is in the dating app's interest to provide its users with as many tools as possible to find the right person.

      1.6.3.2. Pro:
      If people are unable to find a compatible partner in a timely manner, they may stop using the app.

        1.6.3.2.1. Pro:
        On average, it can take a person 2 months [154] to find someone with whom they can have a meaningful relationship. Racial filters may help reduce this time.

        1.6.3.2.2. Pro:
        The owners of these apps need to be able to improve their working model so they can attract more customers and generate profits.

        1.6.3.2.3. Con:
        -> See 1.2.4.1.3.2.

      1.6.3.3. Con:
      There is no concrete evidence that racial filters contribute to people finding compatible partners more quickly or easily.

      1.6.3.4. Con:
      Judging from how many relationships fail after people met offline and had a chance to filter each other out, it seems to be questionable whether we are actually able to select compatible partners.

    1.6.4. Pro:
    If individuals have a preference for partners of a particular race, that is unlikely to change.

      1.6.4.1. Pro:
      Individuals who are 50+ consider race a very important factor [155] when looking at a profile on an online dating app.

      1.6.4.2. Pro:
      Even if racial filters are removed, individuals will likely find other ways to convey their preferences.

        1.6.4.2.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.5.5.2.3.

        1.6.4.2.2. Pro:
        Not having the option to filter by race means eliminating them by looking at their profile. Thus, not having race filters would just take longer for people to find a person.

      1.6.4.3. Con:
      At the very least, getting rid of filters will expose them to different people. It is possible they will discover that their preference is not as strong or exclusive when they are seeing a broader range of people on dating apps.

    1.6.5. Pro:
    -> See 1.2.6.1.1.

    1.6.6. Con:
    It has been argued that people’s preferences when it comes to dating are not purely the result of choice but are actually “shaped by accretions of state and social power” (p. 3 [156]).

      1.6.6.1. Pro:
      At various points in history, the US government has had laws in place which restricted the types of relationships that could occur, such as anti-miscegenation laws that prohibited interracial marriages (p. 3 [157]). These can influence the social view of those relationships, even when the laws have changed.

        1.6.6.1.1. Con:
        Anti-miscegenation laws were declared [158] unconstitutional in the US in 1967. If laws influence dating preferences, then the effects of anti-miscegenation laws should be minimal at this point.

      1.6.6.2. Con:
      While people's romantic preferences may be shaped by a number of different factors, this doesn't mean they are not real or legitimate.

        1.6.6.2.1. Pro:
        Even if the preferences are not shaped within the individual but society, they are still their sexual preferences that need to be respected.

      1.6.6.3. Pro:
      The notion that an entire race is "unattractive" is based on negative stereotypes [159]. Acting on preferences founded on harmful racial stereotypes is racist.

      1.6.6.4. Con:
      Given that social power is almost always prejudiced in favour of certain races, it is the responsibility of an individual to make sure that their choices do not further this prejudice.

    1.6.7. Pro:
    Psychologists found [160] that people are naturally attracted to what is familiar to them. Race, among various other attributes, is one such thing.

    1.6.8. Pro:
    Filters are a transparent and open way of dealing with racial preferences of users, whereas algorithmic suggestions are not.

    1.6.9. Pro:
    Websites and applications are coded with specific keywords. In order to satisfate their customers, apps propose a large filter of the customers' needs. The liberty of the customers' preferences on dating searches should not be regulated.

    1.6.10. Con:
    Race filters may not be reliable because people can catfish others into believing that they're of a certain race when they are not.

    1.6.11. Pro:
    Not being able to filter for what you are looking for simply wastes time. People are likely to move onto another app, if this is enforced.

      1.6.11.1. Con:
      Whether a function is good for user retention and a company's bottom line generally says little about whether this function is "good" in a more abstract sense, and especially so when sensitive and difficult issues of race are involved.

    1.6.12. Pro:
    As long as people have the same filter in their heads, not having a race filter wouldn't have any effects.

    1.6.13. Con:
    If certain races are constantly filtered, they might not be favored by the algorithms of dating apps. This can end up affecting how they are recommended to other users.

      1.6.13.1. Pro:
      The AWS image recognition system [161], which is a part of Tinder's algorithm, uses the depiction in the user's pictures to profile them for matches.

    1.6.14. Con:
    These personal preferences may have been shaped by the depiction of certain races by popular media [162]. The best way to bust these depictions is by interacting with people of other races.

      1.6.14.1. Con:
      It is the responsibility of the media to fix negative racial portrayals, not the responsibility of dating apps.

      1.6.14.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.1.5.1.
