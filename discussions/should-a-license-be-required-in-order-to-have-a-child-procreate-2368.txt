Should a license be required in order to have a child (procreate)?

1. Thesis:
A license should be required in order to have a child (procreate).

  1.1. Con:
  The practicalities of implementing such a policy would make it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to implement in most countries.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    Unexpected pregnancies will still occur.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      Many parents who unintentionally become pregnant in the status quo are able to keep custody of the child should they decide to not get an abortion. Without a parenting license, many of these people would be at a greater risk of losing custody.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Not all parents who become pregnant unexpectedly will fail to acquire a license.

      1.1.1.3. Pro:
      A significant proportion of the pregnancies worldwide are unplanned.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        In 2013, it was estimated that one in six pregnancies among women in Britain are unplanned, and one in sixty [1] women (1.5%) experience an unplanned pregnancy in a year. This is a huge number of children the state would have to take away.

        1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
        In the US in 2010, more than half of all pregnancies in 28 states were unintentional [2] and the lowest rate for any state was 36%.

        1.1.1.3.3. Pro:
        Almost half of all pregnancies worldwide are unplanned (p. 1 [3]). Given this, to require a license to procreate would mean total prevention of pregnancy in the first instance which, in turn, interferes with individuals' bodily autonomy.

        1.1.1.3.4. Con:
        Better family planning education, as would stem from a parenting licensing system, would help reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies worldwide (p. 13 [4]).

        1.1.1.3.5. Con:
        Even though unplanned pregnancy rates may be high in some regions, most pregnancies in the developed world [5] are still planned.

    1.1.2. Con:
    Governments have the capacity to overcome the practical difficulties of such a policy.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      Public bodies have a proven record of bureaucratic inefficiency, possibly due to their noncompetitive status (p. 1 [6]).

        1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
        Given the sheer volume of bureaucracy that assessing the global rate of 267 births/minute [7] would entail, this policy could leave a significant backlog of work, rendering it untenable.

          1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Much like in the fostering assessment process, individual screeners would likely be given an overwhelming workload that would impinge on their ability to assess accurately.

            1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            Overloaded case workers [8] can mean flaws and oversight in the screening processes of prospective foster parents and their homes. This can lead to children being placed within foster homes and families that are unsafe or problematic.

            1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
            Digitising [9] the process and tracking of individual assessments could redude screeners' workloads.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        There a a number of effective solutions [10] governments can take to iron out the problems associated with bureaucracy.

          1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          Digitising tasks and records can reduce the burden on potentially overworked staff as well as reducing adminitrative errors (p. 22 [11]).

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Governments would have the breadth of knowledge required to assess individuals.

        1.1.2.2.1. Con:
        Around a quarter [12] of children under five across the world have never had their births registered. As such, many countries will simply not have the data they would need in order to enforce this policy.

        1.1.2.2.2. Pro:
        A parenting license would require prospective parents to meet certain criteria before being approved.

          1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          Parenting standards and potential are scrutinised when assessing the suitability of adoptive parents and foster carers. A parenting license assessment could be conducted on similar merits.

            1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
            Some adopted children tend to be particularly vulnerable [13], and so there may be a need to have a higher standard for prospective adoptive parents than for biological parents.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
              If this is the case, then the standard being applied to all parents under a licensing system would be higher, thus leading to better parenting.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro:
              Children who are adopted from other countries would take longer to adapt to a new language and culture [14], and as a result, may require parents with extra training or time.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.1.3. Pro:
              Many children who are in need of adoptive families have come from abusive homes. This can result in various developmental issues [15], which would require their care to encorprate additional support and expertise.

            1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro:
            Foster carers are subject to regular reviews [16], after they have been approved, to ensure the required criteria are upheld in the long-run.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
              According to the Child Advocate Review, the quality of safety assessments only met standards in 46% of reviewed cases (p. 15 [17]).

              1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con:
              Some foster parents are accused of undertaking the role to benefit from the financial stipend [18] that comes with it, rather than to care for the incoming child.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
                Providing foster parents with financial compensation for their work is simply a way to attribute value to the labour which society traditionally undervalues.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2. Pro:
                Some agencies view the stipend offered to foster parents as a fee for a professional [19] service, suggesting that the role is regarded as a way of making money rather than a way of caring for a child in need.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.3. Pro:
                Caring for children with autism or physical disabilities comes with a higher weekly stipend [20], thereby putting these vulnerable children at further risk of ending up with a foster parent who is 'in it for the money'.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.4. Con:
                On average, the stipend that foster parents receive is equivalent to $1/hour and does not even cover the child's living expenses. Fostering thus often costs the carers [21] money, rather than earning them any additional income.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3. Pro:
              Prospective foster carers are assessed on their understanding of key issues including sexual boundaries, promotion of education, and approaches to discipline (p. 8 [22]).

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
                There are a number of testimonies [23] from those who have had negative experiences of foster care. The assessment process is therefore far from fool-proof.

                  1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
                  In the UK [24], 88% of abuse or neglect in foster care is perpetrated by the carers themselves.

                  1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2. Pro:
                  Private foster care agencies have allowed [25] criminals and registered sex offenders to acquire licenses and adopt foster children. This has led to neglect, sexual abuse, and murders of children.

                    1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                    Birth children of foster parents have abused [26] foster children living in the same house. A failure to screen all members of the household leads to such abuse.

                    1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro:
                    A caseworker in one foster agency reported that three girls were happy and healthy in their foster home when they had been dead for three months [27]. This is indicative of the ineptitude possible in foster care agencies.

                    1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.3. Pro:
                    Many LGBTQ children in foster homes suffer abuse. As a result, in the US, many LGBTQ youth have experienced homelessness [28] because they believed they were safer on the streets than they were in their foster homes.

                    1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.4. Con:
                    Many states allow former criminals to adopt, once they have shown evidence of their rehabilitation [29]. The fact that criminals may be allowed to adopt is not, in and of itself, an issue.

                  1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.3. Con:
                  Individual testimonies do not serve to invalidate the entire process.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.2. Pro:
                Assessors also contact prospective foster carers' previous partners and non-relatives for references [30] so that their personality and capabilities are evidenced.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.2.4. Pro:
              Prospective carers must guarantee that the incoming child will be given appropriate accommodation (pp. 3-4 [31]).

                1.1.2.2.2.1.2.4.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.

            1.1.2.2.2.1.3. Pro:
            Adopting a child requires a certain set of conditions [32] to be met. Given that society approves of this, there is no reason why we should not impose these conditions on those who wish to procreate.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
              As in vitro and other artificial methods of insemination become more available (p. 17 [33]), the line between adoption and biological offspring is likely to be blurred further, meaning that standards for parenthood should be universal across all methods of having children.

              1.1.2.2.2.1.3.2. Con:
              Bureaucratic red tape and imperfect, discriminatory adoption criteria prevent [34] many inviduals from adopting children.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.3.2.1. Con:
                No policy is ever perfectly planned, and submitting its conditions to a standard of perfection is unreasonable.

                1.1.2.2.2.1.3.2.2. Pro:
                Deserving parents have been rejected for the most tedious of reasons, such as living on a farm [35].

                1.1.2.2.2.1.3.2.3. Pro:
                Red tape can make the process incredibly daunting [36], and so suitable couples may not even apply to become adoptive parents if they assume they would not be successful.

          1.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
          There is no way to accurately assess a person's parenting capabilities.

            1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro:
            Different countries [37] have extremely different parenting styles; what is deemed good in one country may be deemed bad in another. This is further testament to the lack of objectivity in determining what makes for good parenting.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
              Just as adoption laws vary by country [38], licensing laws will be decided by individual governments. Thus, licensing policies are likely to be in line with regional cultural standards and expectations of good parenting.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                Not all cultural groups within one country have similar standards of parenting. Some groups, for example, do not have biological parents as primary caregivers for their children.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                  For example, Aboriginal Australians have a complex kinship system [39] which is only loosely related to biological lineage. This falls outside of the norm of what some cultures would consider 'normal' parenting.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                  In the culture of Navajo, for instance, children are not regarded as children of the parents but rather children of the clan (p. 611 [40]).

              1.1.2.2.2.2.1.2. Pro:
              While in Korea the traditional approach of cultivating obedience in children remains popular, Scandinavian parents prefer [41] building a more democratic relationship with their children.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.1.3. Pro:
              Different parts of the world [42], and different racial or ethnic groups, have differing opinions on the merits of corporal punishment [43].

                1.1.2.2.2.2.1.3.1. Con:
                Findings from strong, empirical analyses [44] document adverse outcomes from physical discipline use, including spanking.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.1.3.2. Pro:
                Some countries have made spanking illegal [45], while it is a part of other cultures [46].

            1.1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro:
            The most important metrics for such a test would be subjective, which means they cannot be accurately assessed.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro:
              Even if parents engage in the system as honestly as possible, a one time assessment cannot account for the varying levels of parenting stress a parent may face throughout their life, which highly affects [47] their parenting behaviour.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2. Pro:
              The extent to which mental health and mental illnesses impact parenting capabilities varies from person to person.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro:
                Mental health problems can vary in terms of the severity [48] of the impact they have on a person's ability to parent.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.2. Pro:
                Those who have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can be less competent in their parenting, but those with BPD who can subjectively enter the mind of their child are better able to competently parent (p. 12 [49]).

              1.1.2.2.2.2.2.3. Con:
              It is better to assess some things that affect parenting than to assess none. While the licensing policy won't be able to identify all bad prospective parents, it is useful to be able to identify as many as we can.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.2.4. Pro:
              It is impossible to determine whether a parent will be overly-controlling, protective, or pressuring from a test that is likely to depend on self-diagnosis.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.2.5. Pro:
              A parenting license incentivises people to cover up or lie about their flaws, rather than seeking help.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.2.5.1. Con:
                Those with flawed parenting traits already cover up [50] such tendencies.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.2.5.2. Pro:
                For example, someone who struggles with substance abuse [51] but hopes to one day be a parent may be less likely to engage with the rehabilitation infrastructure if they fear it is likely to be held against them [52] when they apply for a license, as it sometimes is in adoption cases.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.2.5.2.1. Con:
                  In the European Union, GDPR [53] prevents the sharing of an individual's information for purposes for which they have not consented. Attempts to share information between agencies would therefore contravene this regulation.

            1.1.2.2.2.2.3. Con:
            What makes a parent good may be difficult to define, but what makes a parent unacceptably bad is easy to define and detect. Every child deserves a minimally competent parent.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1. Pro:
              A significant number of parents abuse their children. They should be prevented from having children prior to abusing them.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.1. Pro:
                In the US, parents are the perpetrators [54] in 78% of cases of fatal child abuse.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2. Con:
                It is not possible to perfectly detect potentially abusive parents prior to the abuse taking place.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                  Abusers tend to hide their abusive tendencies.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    Those with abusive tendencies usually share some personality traits [55], such as jealousy and hypersensitivity, which can be difficult to mask.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                    Anyone can be abusive [56], regardless of gender, age, sexuality, race, economic status, ability, citizenship status, or any other factor or identity.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.1.3. Pro:
                    It is common for abusers to seem caring and amicable to a wider circle of friends and acquaintances, but behave very differently when alone [57] with their victim.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.2. Pro:
                  Even the most well-intentioned parents may not be able to protect their child from another abusive person in the child's life, such as another family member who would not have to take a test.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.3. Con:
                  -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.2.3.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.3. Pro:
                In 2014 in the US, approximately 4.5 million children were registered as victims of neglect [58], where the parent failed to meet the child's basic needs, such as leaving them hungry or dirty, or without adequate clothing, shelter, supervision, medical or health care.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4. Pro:
                Childhood neglect and abuse can have a lasting negative effect on victims.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1. Pro:
                  Children who are abused are more likely to develop mental illnesses [59] such as depression, anxiety or PTSD, amongst others.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.2. Con:
                  Some victims of childhood abuse can overcome the horrors of their past and become resolute and resilient (p. 168 [60]).

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.2.1. Con:
                    In trying to overcome their trauma, children who are abused can develop harmful coping mechanisms [61] that often stay with them for life, such as eating disorders, drug use or self harm.

                      1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.2.1.1. Pro:
                      Many of those who suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder, a rare but severe psychiatric disorder, have a history of being abused or neglected [62]. The disorder is thought to stem from ways some children try to mentally isolate themselves against the horror of unremitting abuse.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.2.2. Pro:
                    There are protective factors [63], such as a sense of community in adulthood, which help to mitigate the mental health harms of childhood abuse.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.3. Pro:
                  A 70 year-long study [64] shows that overly-controlling parents could cause children lifelong psychological damage.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.3.1. Con:
                    -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.2.4.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2. Pro:
              There are reasons to believe that poverty makes for bad parents.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.1. Con:
                A licensing and regulatory state apparatus would cost money that could otherwise be invested in more robust aid programs for parents living in poverty.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                  Anti-poverty measures [65] are effective at preventing children arriving in foster care.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2. Pro:
                Wealth can ensure that children have access to goods and activities which can make their lives better.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.1. Pro:
                  The social life of children is affected by their brand-relationship [66]. Children who cannot afford consumer goods such as new iPhones or fashionable clothes may be socially stigmatised by the children who can.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
                    This is a flaw within society and should not be encouraged by mandating that parents are able to buy their children branded products.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.2. Con:
                  There is no guarantee that parents will use their wealth effectively to improve the lives of their children.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3. Pro:
                  It can be very expensive to do sports or play instruments.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.1. Pro:
                    The average cost of a half-hour piano lesson in the US can be anywhere from $40-$60 [67] USD.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.2. Pro:
                    Research [68] suggests that spending on sports in America has grown up to 10.5% of gross income.

                    1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.3. Con:
                    It is not necessary for a child to engage in organized, and therefore expensive, sports or music.

                      1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.3.1. Pro:
                      Children can exercise and play sports with their friends without paying for coaching with a sports team.

                      1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.3.2. Con:
                      Music classes help children expand their creative horizons, and improve their academic capabilities [69] as a result.

                      1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.3.3. Con:
                      Playing sports in a club helps to foster relationships and role models for children [70].

                      1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.3.3.4. Pro:
                      Music is not usually a mandatory [71] subject in schools.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.2.4. Con:
                  If common goods and activities are inaccessible to children because they are too expensive, that is a failure of the state to provide accessible options, not poor parents.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.3. Con:
                Wealth and income are poor standards of measuring parenting ability.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.1. Pro:
                  Growing up in extreme wealth can lead to a higher risk [72] of substance abuse, depression and anxiety.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.2. Pro:
                  The number of eating disorders and rates of self-harming amongst children who grew up in affluent families are far higher than the national averages (p. 3 [73]).

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.3. Con:
                  Higher parental income [74] is linked to happier, healthier, and more successful children.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.4. Pro:
                Poverty has been shown to lead to disrupted parenting due to stress and depression (p. 12 [75]).

              1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3. Pro:
              Under the status quo, a lot of people with violent criminal histories and substance abuse issues are allowed to have children. Licenses would prevent these people from having children.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.1. Pro:
                A quarter of children [76] exposed to parental substance abuse do not receive the medical care and attention required in the first 2 years of their life, thereby putting their development and wellbeing at risk.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.2. Pro:
                Children of alcoholics are more likely [77] to develop alcoholism in later life than those born to parents with no alcohol dependency issues.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.3. Pro:
                Children of parents with substance abuse issues are more than two times more likely [78] to be exposed to childhood physical and sexual abuse.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4. Con:
                Pregnancy can be an important motivator [79] for recovery from substance abuse. A license would likely remove this motivation as it would inhibit substance users from being able to keep their child.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.1. Con:
                  Due to the lack of a licensing system, children may be born to a mother who misused substances [80] during pregnancy. These babies may be born with mild to severe withdrawal symptoms or fetal alcohol syndrome. As such, the risk is too high to prioritise the level of motivation of the parents at the cost of potential harm to the child.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.2. Con:
                  While it is an important motivator, it by no means guarantees that these women will be able to recover from substance abuse or engage in other positive lifestyle changes during pregnancy (p. 5 [81]). This runs the risk of placing children in the care of drug addicted mothers.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.3. Con:
                  The vulnerable life of an unborn child should not be used as a tool for correcting the mistakes of a consenting adult.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.4. Pro:
                  The treatment of substance of abuse is becoming increasingly embedded in prenatal care, making it more likely that someone will recover from substance abuse during pregnancy (p. 178 [82]). A parenting license would deny prospective parents who are substance users this opportunity.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.5. Pro:
                  Individuals who were previously denied a license due to substance abuse would be unlikely to keep their child in the event of an accidental pregnancy, even if they had recovered.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.5. Con:
                Statistics are not facts [83] or normative conclusions. As such, people who do not fall within these statistical trends would be unfairly denied the right to have a child.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.3.4. Con:
              The desire of a licensing body will be to ensure a high quality of parenting, since they will have a vested interest in good parenting. Having these individuals decide on a minimum standard would go against their natural inclination towards optimal parenting. This would likely lead to unnecessarily stringent minimum standards.

            1.1.2.2.2.2.4. Pro:
            Since inconsistencies and inefficiencies are inherent in any test, licensing assessments on this scale would be subject to human or administrative errors, thereby denying perfectly adept prospective parents from having children.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.4.1. Con:
              The test will be designed much like any other licensing test, such that if the parents were to fail once, they could take the test again.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.1.1. Pro:
                It is unlikely that deserving parents will fail the test multiple times, as they will be better prepared for each successive retake.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.1.2. Con:
                In such an instance, the child would still be removed from the parents' custody till such time that they passed the test. This separation, even if temporary, would be harmful to the parents and to the child.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.1.3. Con:
                There is no guarantee that everyone will be able to pass the test, especially if financial requirements are part of the licensing process. If people who did not meet the financial requirements were to get pregnant accidentally, they would have no way of keeping that child.

                  1.1.2.2.2.2.4.1.3.1. Pro:
                  In the US, those below or at the federal poverty rate are five times more likely [84] to have an unplanned pregnancy. This is attributed to a combination of a lack of knowledge about, and a lack of resources to acquire, the most effective forms of contraception.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.4.2. Con:
              Problems such as inconsistencies or cheating with the parent licensing test can be dealt with and the margin of error can be minimized. As long as the overall system can properly function, minor incidents should not justify opposing the policy.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.2.1. Pro:
                Inconsistencies and inefficiencies are also inherent within the judicial system [85]. A state establishing a judicial system as a flawed structure that adds order to society is still better than having no legal structure at all.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.2.2. Pro:
                Effectively utilizing error management can significantly limit human and administrative errors (p. 770 [86]).

              1.1.2.2.2.2.4.3. Con:
              This inconsistency already exists in the status quo. Adding a test and licensing system adds some level of order to the inconsistencies that exist, even if the test is not perfect.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.4.4. Pro:
              In the past, administrative and human errors have impeded people from voting [87], mis-scored students' SATs [88] and led to a wrongfully amputated leg [89]. Even when the stakes are high, human error is always a possibility.

                1.1.2.2.2.2.4.4.1. Con:
                Many of these errors, where possible, are quickly and seamlessly rectified or compensated.

              1.1.2.2.2.2.4.5. Pro:
              A mistake [90] in diagnosing a baby's genetic illness resulted in the child being taken into the state's care for 8 months, as suspicions mistakenly fell on the parents.

      1.1.2.3. Pro:
      Governments have billions of dollars [91] to spend, some of which can be apportioned to support a licensing policy and its outcomes.

    1.1.3. Con:
    Fewer people would have children under this policy, resulting in a population decrease that would be of practical benefit to many countries.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      Limiting the population would reduce the problem of overpopulation.

        1.1.3.1.1. Con:
        There are more ethical [92] and effective ways to tackle global population growth than restricting individuals' reproductive rights.

          1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          The promotion of family planning through education would be a preferable policy as it maximizes choice for the individuals involved.

            1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            Significant sexual education [93] has been associated with lower reports of teenage pregnancy.

            1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
            It is preferable for the state to pursue a policy which affords people choice and autonomy to one which dictates to them, as people [94] do not like being told what to do, and may be more likely to act in defiance of the policy as a result.

            1.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con:
            Some people may not be affected by family planning education [95], and continue to have children, therefore minimizing the effect education would have on overpopulation.

              1.1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con:
              This particular study is undermined by the fact that it was commissioned by [96] a noted pro-life supporter and member of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) who had also previously campaigned against sex education in schools, indicating that he had a vested interest in disproving its effects on cutting pregnancy rates.

          1.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
          Parenting licenses would be an immediate solution, which would not require time for attitude and behavioral change. For urgent issues related to overpopulation, like climate change [97], this makes parenting licenses the best option.

            1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con:
            Overpopulation [98] is not meaningfully a cause of climate change, compared to many other factors.

            1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro:
            People are more likely to comply with a social norm when they see others [99] doing so. Waiting for education to produce a negative effect on birth rates would take time, since a critical mass of people would need to comply in the first instance in order to encourage conformity and enact significant social change.

          1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
          Discontinuing [100] policies that incentivise parents to have more children could help reduce birth rates and thus slow population growth.

          1.1.3.1.1.4. Pro:
          Educating young women and girls helps to decrease birth rates [101], since individuals can make informed choices about health prospects, finances, and contraception.

        1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
        Overpopulation can have negative effects on the environment through the overuse of natural resources such as water [102] and fertile soil [103].

        1.1.3.1.3. Pro:
        In countries such as India [104], overpopulation is limiting economic growth. Allowing fewer people to procreate is better for such countries.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      A decrease in population will free up resources, which can then be used to provide a higher quality of life and quality of education for the children that are born.

        1.1.3.2.1. Con:
        Even poorly raised and unplanned children grow up to be taxpayers, and help to create the resources which support others in society as a result.

        1.1.3.2.2. Pro:
        The Earth does not have an infinite capacity [105] to support life. Licenses operate as an effective cap on the human population, allowing for a more sustainable population going forward.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Many countries [106], including Japan, Germany, and Russia, have declining populations. Further limiting the population would exacerbate the problems of labor shortages [107] and overburdened pensions that underpopulation already causes.

        1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
        Businesses in Canada are struggling to expand [108] due to a shortage of suitable workers; this limits growth in the economy and the resources available to be distributed amongst the population.

        1.1.3.3.2. Pro:
        A parenting license will discourage people from having children. The birthrates in many developed countries are already far below the replacement fertility rate [109].

          1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro:
          The policy will lead to stigma against couples who fail to gain a parenting license, which may deter people from applying for a license to begin with.

            1.1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            The failure of prospective parents to acquire a license will lead to judgement from society, where others will assume that they are not good people, since they have been deemed unfit to raise children.

              1.1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
              This could lead to people not wanting those who failed to get a license near their own children.

            1.1.3.3.2.1.2. Con:
            Dealing with failure is a lesson any future parent should know. Failing to get a parenting license is simply an opportunity to learn from one's failure before prospective parents reapply for a license.

        1.1.3.3.3. Con:
        Labor shortages and overburdened pension services arise due to earlier population growth having been too aggressive, not because current and future population growth is too weak. The unsustainable population growth of the past should not be the benchmark striven for.

          1.1.3.3.3.1. Pro:
          Japan's largest generations [110] are approaching, or have recently reached, retirement age.

      1.1.3.4. Con:
      Given how important having children is for people, they will likely work hard to ensure that they obtain a license.

        1.1.3.4.1. Con:
        Fewer people than ever [111] believe that having a child is an important part of life.

        1.1.3.4.2. Pro:
        Research has shown that those with children are happier [112] than those without. Therefore, people, desiring happiness, will work hard to obtain a license.

        1.1.3.4.3. Pro:
        The proportion of Americans who want to have children remains high [113] and has not changed substantially in the last few decades.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    There is no feasible reliable way for registering pregnancies in all or most countries. Because of that, one can't prevent birth of children whose parents don't have licenses for children.

    1.1.5. Pro:
    The economic costs of a parenting licensing program are too high for many countries to bear relative to the benefits.

      1.1.5.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.1.

      1.1.5.2. Pro:
      The majority of areas with the highest birth rates [114] are already poorer, developing nations. The additional cost of processing and providing parenting licenses to new families in these nations would impose a large financial burden on their governments and, by extension, be to the detriment of their citizens.

      1.1.5.3. Con:
      The direct and indirect costs [115] of the welfare state are well established; the cost of preventable lifetime human suffering from incapable parenting is priceless.

    1.1.6. Pro:
    Such a law risks being unenforceable without the threat of violence that only a totalitarian state can provide.

      1.1.6.1. Pro:
      There are an estimated 13 million children [116] in China that were born without state permission. This indicates the difficulty of ensuring compliance with a policy that regulates procreation.

        1.1.6.1.1. Pro:
        While officially only using fines [117] to incentivise compliance, the People's Republic of China has had to resort to violent and extremely invasive methods to ensure the implementation of its One-Child Policy.

          1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro:
          China's policy and fining system led to families killing their newborns [118] if they were a girl.

          1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro:
          In order to prevent families from having children without state permission, the government created an "abortion police [119]" on the local level, which served as a tool for local surveillance and was widely feared.

      1.1.6.2. Con:
      Barriers to activities that affect the functioning of society are already enforced, such as practicing law [120] or medicine [121]. Licensing parents to raise healthy and productive future members of society is not vastly different.

        1.1.6.2.1. Pro:
        Like any other job role, parenting requires a minimum standard of competence in order to ensure that the child is raised well.

        1.1.6.2.2. Con:
        Parenting should not be seen as analogous to professions like medicine and law.

          1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro:
          It would be extremely problematic if a doctor prescribed medicine without any understanding of the illness and was using trial and error. In contrast, learning how to provide care to a child who was ill can be learnt through experience.

          1.1.6.2.2.2. Pro:
          Medicine [122] and law [123] both require years of training and learning, whereas parenting typically comes naturally to people.

            1.1.6.2.2.2.1. Con:
            Parenting styles and quality can vary wildly. A licensing system will at the very least teach the basics of raising a child, guaranteeing a minimum standard of parenting and care.

            1.1.6.2.2.2.2. Con:
            Parenting does not come naturally [124] to everyone. For example, adults who were victims of child abuse may struggle.

            1.1.6.2.2.2.3. Pro:
            Most young mothers [125] believe parenting comes naturally to them.

              1.1.6.2.2.2.3.1. Con:
              Young mothers may not be aware of how much they do not know. Older mothers are less confident [126] that their ability comes naturally.

            1.1.6.2.2.2.4. Pro:
            Parenting is an instinct [127] that has evolved in many animals, humans included, to ensure the survival of their species.

          1.1.6.2.2.3. Con:
          Failure as a parent, along with failure as a doctor or a lawyer, has severe consequences.

      1.1.6.3. Pro:
      Historically, instances of restricting unintended procreation among specific groups [128] in society have been achieved by forced use of contraceptive methods, including forced sterilisation [129].

        1.1.6.3.1. Pro:
        Forced sterilization can constitute genocide [130] and discrimination, and has been used across the world to oppress [131] minority groups.

      1.1.6.4. Pro:
      Without totalitarian violence, those with the means might move to other countries with less stringent requirements in order to be able to have children.

        1.1.6.4.1. Con:
        For parents, leaving the country would likely mean leaving any stable job. Their potential children will end up even worse off than before the licensing law.

        1.1.6.4.2. Pro:
        In most cases, parents have the majority of a pregnancy to plan the birth of their child. There is no reason why those in licensed states could not simply cross a border before giving birth in order to circumvent licensing requirements.

  1.2. Pro:
  Governments are obligated to improve and maintain citizens' quality of life. Introducing parenting licenses would help facilitate this.

    1.2.1. Con:
    The responsibility to maximise quality of life lies with the individual, not the state.

      1.2.1.1. Pro:
      It is the duty of the benign state only to reflect [132] accurately the values and choices of the governed, as decided through elections and other polling initiatives. Unless quality of life has been stipulated as one such value - via an election or ballot initiative, for example - it is not automatically the responsibility of the state.

      1.2.1.2. Con:
      The negative effects of bad parenting, including bad behaviour [133] and increased likelihood of substance abuse [134], affect society at large. It is therefore the duty of the state to minimise such harm.

      1.2.1.3. Con:
      While responsibility initially rests with the individuals, if the individuals agree to a state policy to hold themselves accountable, the state becomes responsible to provide that accountability.

      1.2.1.4. Pro:
      People have different views of what makes for a good life, so state intervention should only intervene in ways that maximize their options for their lives, leaving exclusive control [135] over an individual's choices to the individual themselves.

        1.2.1.4.1. Pro:
        A parenting license would ultimately limit people's choices and confine them to the state's expectations.

        1.2.1.4.2. Con:
        The state is justified [136] in limiting what people can do if it helps to minimize harm in society.

        1.2.1.4.3. Pro:
        The government of a state is ultimately made up of a small, and often privileged, group of individuals who have a limited conception [137] of what constitutes a good life.

    1.2.2. Pro:
    The biggest beneficiaries of a parenting licensing policy would be unborn children, to which the state owe a moral - and to some extent legal - duty.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      The state must take into consideration the future implications of a policy when implementing it.

        1.2.2.1.1. Con:
        Unconceived future children, either as specific intended children or as future generations, have no current ontological status and thus no current interests or rights.

          1.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
          As long as a currently unconceived person can be portrayed as an actual victim of harm once they exist, they have a right to not be harmed at this point in time.

          1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro:
          Rights matter only to the extent that they can be exercised. Since unborn children do not have the ability or the notion to exercise rights, their rights should not be considered when making policy.

            1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
            Babies cannot exercise their rights either, as they have limited agency, yet the state still protects their rights [138] and does not give parents unlimited control over them.

            1.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro:
            Some philosophers conceptualize rights as "privileges [139]", where the right-holder has to be able to act on the right.

              1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
              Under this framework, rights can also be "claims [140]", where they confer a duty on a person to do or not to do something. Therefore, an unborn child could have a "claim" over its parents.

            1.2.2.1.1.2.3. Pro:
            The rights of a child do not exist until it is born, since - until that point - its mother is responsible [141] for all decisions pertaining to its health and wellbeing.

        1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
        Safeguards are already in place in some areas to protect the interests of unborn babies [142]. Parenting licences would be an extension of this.

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      The legal system has found that the government does not owe a duty to the unborn [143] above the duty owed to living individuals.

        1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
        In the United States, Roe v. Wade [144] (1973) confirmed that the rights of the unborn are not to be put above that of the mother.

          1.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
          Roe v. Wade (1973) is at risk of being overturned [145] by the US Supreme Court.

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        A child is not legally recognised as a person until birth in the United Kingdom (p. 476 [146]).

        1.2.2.2.3. Con:
        Many countries in Latin America have strict abortion laws, which imply [147] that the state has a duty towards the unborn.

    1.2.3. Con:
    A state licensing policy could be used for the purpose of eugenics [148], which would compromise the quality of life of many of the state's citizens.

      1.2.3.1. Con:
      A licensing system could prevent the procreation of people with severe hereditary disorders by requiring prospective biological parents to pass a basic physical health standard in order to be allowed to procreate, and eradicate severe hereditary disorders from society.

        1.2.3.1.1. Con:
        There are significant ethical issues that prenatal screening of hereditary disorders has raised which run counter to the reduction of ill-health in society (p. 112 [149]).

          1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          There are issues of informed consent and reproductive autonomy for parents who may not have been made sufficiently aware of the positive quality of life that can be experienced by people with hereditary diseases, instead receiving misleading information (p. 6 [150]).

          1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          Prenatal screening and selective aborting have been compared to a form of eugenics that is discriminatory against people with genetic disabilities (p. 410 [151]).

          1.2.3.1.1.3. Con:
          Normal results in prenatal screening tests can help to ease the anxiety of expectant parents [152].

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        Such a policy would imply that a human life is less valuable if there is a genetic disorder present, and people currently living with these sorts of conditions are less likely to receive support from society if they are seen as less valuable.

        1.2.3.1.3. Pro:
        Some genetic disorders severely impact the quality of life [153] of both children and parents.

          1.2.3.1.3.1. Con:
          People with severe hereditary disorders can live fruitful and fulfilling lives, contribute greatly to society, and achieve incredible things. As such, society has no right to restrict parent's procreation based on their genetic traits or to deny their potential child the right to life.

            1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
            Many people [154] who are famous for their talents and contributions to society have suffered from genetic diseases.

              1.2.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              Stephen Hawking [155], who had Motor Neurone Disease [156], was the author of an international bestseller, a professor at Cambridge University, and is still seen as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history.

              1.2.3.1.3.1.1.2. Pro:
              Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec [157], who suffered from a congenital illness, was a renowned post-impressionist painter.

              1.2.3.1.3.1.1.3. Pro:
              Niccolo Paganini [158], the most celebrated violinist of his time, likely suffered from a hereditary disease of connective tissue; either Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan's syndrome.

              1.2.3.1.3.1.1.4. Con:
              These individuals are a minority compared to the population as a whole.

          1.2.3.1.3.2. Pro:
          The parents of children with certain hereditary disorders have been seen to have higher levels of psychological distress than normal (p. 113 [159]). This can be prevented with a licensing policy.

        1.2.3.1.4. Con:
        Even if this were to be done, there is no guarantee of the success of such a policy.

          1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro:
          For most hereditary disorders, parental screening [160] can only provide a probability on the child inheriting a particular genetic abnormality, and so may not even be an effective way at eradicating such disorders.

            1.2.3.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            For diseases that carry the autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, even if both parents carry the faulty gene, there is still only 50% chance their child will inherit the disease (p. 3 [161]).

            1.2.3.1.4.1.2. Con:
            While this policy may prevent healthy children from being born, it definitely prevents unhealthy children from being born, preventing many children from living miserable and painful lives.

            1.2.3.1.4.1.3. Pro:
            Since most people [162] carry one to two recessive gene mutations, with a risk of passing on a genetic disease to their child if two copies are inherited, limiting people from procreating on probabilities and risks alone would affect the vast majority of society and have significant impacts on rates of reproduction.

          1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro:
          Genetic conditions are not always inherited: some can arise without precedent (p. 1 [163]).

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      Licensing could discriminate against the disabled.

        1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
        Those with disabilities are already more likely to lose or be denied custody of their children. For parents with psychiatric or intellectual disabilities, this can happen in up to 80% [164] of cases. It is unlikely these individuals would be granted a license.

          1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro:
          This occurs despite research that indicates that IQ does not correlate [165] with good or bad parenting.

        1.2.3.2.2. Con:
        It could alternatively benefit the disabled. Disabled parents may be seen as more qualified [166] to raise disabled children.

          1.2.3.2.2.1. Con:
          There are many challenges [167] associated with raising a disabled child, which may be particularly difficult to overcome for someone who themselves have disabilities.

          1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro:
          A disabled person may be seen as having the experiences necessary to empathize with their disabled child, as they will have had similar life experiences.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    By restricting the ability of unsuitable individuals to conceive to begin with, parenting licenses allow for earlier state control than current child protection processes and, by extension, keep more children out of state care. This is in the best interests of both child and parent(s), as well as society.

      1.2.4.1. Con:
      The act of parenting itself can change a person for the better. A parenting license would take that chance away from a person because of their present condition without taking into account that parenting could inspire them to do better.

        1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.3.3.4.

        1.2.4.1.2. Con:
        It is unethical to stake a child's well-being on the mere chance that someone will better their life.

          1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro:
          There is no guarantee that individuals become responsible after having children, which is why bad parents exist. It is better to prevent those who have minimal chances of becoming good parents from procreating.

        1.2.4.1.3. Pro:
        Becoming a parent can help a person develop [168] empathy, discipline and sensitivity.

        1.2.4.1.4. Pro:
        Becoming a parent [169] can lead someone to gaining organizational abilities with regards to time and finances, as well as strength and confidence in themselves.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      Since there is a widespread belief [170] that biological children are preferable to adoptees, there is a chance that, once in the care of the state, many children will remain there indefinitely.

        1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
        The norm to conceive biological children is so strong that many people feel pressure to procreate.

          1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro:
          These norms [171] are so prevalent that people often struggle to understand why someone would choose to adopt over biologically conceiving a child, and are often quick to assume that such individuals are incapable of having children.

          1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro:
          According to one study, 52% of women experiencing fertility difficulties felt devastated, while the remaining 48% felt very bad, showing how pervasive the norm towards biological children is (p. 1851 [172]).

          1.2.4.2.1.3. Con:
          In developed countries, such as the US, birth rates have fallen in recent years (p. 1 [173]). This suggests that individuals may be starting to feel less pressured by society to have children.

        1.2.4.2.2. Con:
        The adoption process itself, rather than an absence of desire to adopt, is what prevents many from adopting children.

          1.2.4.2.2.1. Pro:
          For those who wish to adopt from a private agency or internationally, it can cost [174] prospective parents anywhere between $5000 and $40,000. This can be an unbearable cost for many.

          1.2.4.2.2.2. Con:
          The adoption process can be changed to make it easier to navigate for prospective parents.

            1.2.4.2.2.2.1. Pro:
            If the goal is to provide care and safety for children, we should do everything to make that process as efficient as possible.

            1.2.4.2.2.2.2. Con:
            Adoption restrictions are necessarily [175] tight in order to ensure children are not placed in dangerous or abusive environments.

          1.2.4.2.2.3. Pro:
          Adoption agencies are underfunded and overworked [176], which leads to high turnover of staff and delays in getting children adopted.

          1.2.4.2.2.4. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.2.2.2.1.3.2.

          1.2.4.2.2.5. Con:
          Since under the status quo, it is much easier to have biological children than to adopt, a parenting license may level the playing field and encourage people to adopt.

            1.2.4.2.2.5.1. Pro:
            People are becoming more aware of the negatives associated with childbirth, such as PTSD [177] and lasting physical health complications [178]. As a result, they may be more likely to choose to adopt than to have biological children.

            1.2.4.2.2.5.2. Con:
            -> See 1.1.3.4.

        1.2.4.2.3. Pro:
        People fear that forming a relationship with an adopted child will be difficult.

          1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro:
          Some parents have concerns [179] over whether they'll actually be able to bond with adopted children like they would be able to if they had biological children - especially if the to-be adopted child has had previous experiences that may affect their development.

          1.2.4.2.3.2. Pro:
          Some can worry [180] that the adopted child will always wonder about their biological parents, and as a result, never be able to properly bond with them.

          1.2.4.2.3.3. Con:
          Fear of lack of connection [181] to one's children, biological or otherwise, is common across all walks of parenting and therefore not specific to those who adopt.

        1.2.4.2.4. Con:
        There are currently enough prospective parents who wish to adopt in many countries.

          1.2.4.2.4.1. Con:
          The UK is already dealing with a shortage of foster parents and suitable adoptive families, resulting in an over-stretched care system [182] and children unable to leave it.

          1.2.4.2.4.2. Pro:
          Estimates suggest [183] that about two million couples in the US are currently waiting to adopt a child. This equates to around 36 families for every child placed up for adoption.

          1.2.4.2.4.3. Pro:
          In 2015, in the UK, there were more people wanting to adopt a child than there were [184] children waiting to be adopted.

            1.2.4.2.4.3.1. Con:
            By 2019 [185], there were twice as many children waiting to be adopted in the UK than there were families waiting to adopt.

      1.2.4.3. Con:
      The state does not get a legitimate claim to the custody of children whose parents fail to get a license.

        1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
        Where parents fail to provide basic conditions for their children, this is often at least in part due to a failure on the part of the state.

          1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          Many people are trapped in a cycle of poverty [186], from which escape is incredibly difficult, if at all possible. Preventing the poor from having children is punishing them for something they have no control over.

          1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro:
          External factors, such as social class [187] and education, are more important to a child's long-term success than bad parenting. Addressing these other issues would be a more productive way of improving children's lives.

          1.2.4.3.1.3. Con:
          The responsibility of providing basic conditions [188] for the child rests inherently with the parent.

          1.2.4.3.1.4. Con:
          If prospective parents fall pregnant, and fail to obtain a license to raise that child, they are responsible for providing the child, not the state.

            1.2.4.3.1.4.1. Pro:
            There are various preventative methods that are accessible to people who wish to engage in intercourse but aren't ready for parenthood.

              1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1. Con:
              As they usually carry the responsibility of ensuring adequate birth control, such a license would burden women more than men.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
                The pill and female sterilisation are the two most common contraceptive methods in the US, and have been since 1982 [189]. This suggests the burden of ensuring a couple does not have an unintended pregnancy almost always falls on the woman.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
                In countries where birth control and abortions are illegal [190], due to the biological attachment women have to children, it is more likely for a woman to deal with the trauma and burden of an unlicensed child than a man.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                  More women are likely to feel pressured into an abortion if they fail to get a licence, since they may perceive the trauma associated with a termination to be less than that of losing their child to the state.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro:
                  Anti-abortion [191] laws and the public discussion surrounding them exemplify how restricting bodily autonomy ends up being used as a tool for oppressing women's rights.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.3. Pro:
                Women in the US still face many obstacles [192] when trying to get contraception, which is why 20 million women in need of free birth control cannot access it.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                  In states in the US which do not have expanded Medicaid coverage, more than two million poor adults are uninsured [193].

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.4. Con:
                Given the advancement of science - through procedures such as vasalgel [194] - it is possible to significantly reduce the risk of becoming an unplanned parent. By making such prevention the legal norm, aspiring parents would have to acquire the license before being able to conceive.

              1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2. Con:
              This is true only of countries where family planning is legal or affordable, or where citizens have easy access to healthcare institutions.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
                The cost of abortion can be prohibitive [195] for women in some places.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                  In countries where abortions are illegal, and for women who cannot afford the costs, women would likely turn to unsafe abortions [196], which can often result in maternal illness or death.

                    1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                    In Kenya, where abortion is only permitted in cases deemed an emergency, safe abortions offered by doctors are many times the cost [197] of 'slum clinics'.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                  In the US, those below or at the federal poverty line are three times less likely [198] to have an abortion due to lack of funds as compared to the more affluent in society.

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.1.3. Con:
                  Norway [199] provides all women with free access to abortion services.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
                Only one in 50 [200] women in the US can easily access clinics that stock the contraceptives they need.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.3. Con:
                The policy would create an impetus for states to provide safe and accessible birth control and abortion for their citizens.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.4. Pro:
                Many countries still limit free and open access to contraceptives through barriers like requiring people to have a prescription [201].

                  1.2.4.3.1.4.1.2.4.1. Pro:
                  In Pakistan [202], where family planning is at odds with many traditional family views, just 20% of women aged 15-49 use contraception.

              1.2.4.3.1.4.1.4. Pro:
              Condoms [203], which can be easily used to prevent pregnancy, usually cost between 20¢ and $2.50 USD in the US.

              1.2.4.3.1.4.1.5. Pro:
              Etonogestrel implants, which last for 3 years, and hormonal IUDs, which last for 5 years, only cost around $37 Australian dollars and are subsidized by the Australian government. [204]

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.5.1. Con:
                No form of hormonal [205] or invasive [206] birth control comes without risks, some of which can be fatal.

              1.2.4.3.1.4.1.6. Pro:
              There are many institutions and organizations which can provide free contraceptives.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.6.2. Con:
                Free provision is only part of the solution; the main reason many women do not use birth control in some regions is because of social attitudes (p. 161 [207]).

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.6.3. Pro:
                Organizations like Projekt Sex [208] provides free condoms for people living in Sweden.

                1.2.4.3.1.4.1.6.4. Pro:
                A pack of birth control pills [209], which can last up to a month, are free through most health insurance plans in the US.

                There exist a large number of Youth Guidance Centres in Sweden and most offer free birth control [210] for youths.

          1.2.4.3.1.5. Pro:
          The state often fails to provide parents with the infrastructure required to be good, responsible parents.

            The state often provides public schooling opportunities.

              1.2.4.3.1.5.1.1. Con:
              In the US, the standards of public schools vary substantially [211], and so cannot be said to be a uniformly adequate provision of services.

              1.2.4.3.1.5.1.2. Pro:
              Many countries have high quality [212] public school systems.

            1.2.4.3.1.5.2. Con:
            Tax credits [213] based on the number of children a parent has helps to provide them with financial relief.

            1.2.4.3.1.5.3. Pro:
            Inadequate welfare policy means that poor parents never have enough money to pay for their children's needs.

              1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1. Con:
              In many states, the government does provide financial assistance to parents, in the form of child benefit [214] payments.

                1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1.1. Con:
                This financial assistance is usually only a small amount of money, available to few people.

                  1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                  In Ireland, as of 2021, child benefit is only €140 a month [215] per child.

                  1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro:
                  The UK has strict conditions [216] on who can avail of this financial assistance, and only provides parents with a small weekly payment for their first child, with even less provided for subsequent children.

                  1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1.1.3. Con:
                  Under European Law, many EU member states provide all parent residents, including non-citizens [217], with generous child support payments.

                1.2.4.3.1.5.3.1.2. Pro:
                Child benefits help parents meet [218] the cost of clothes, food and school supplies.

              1.2.4.3.1.5.3.2. Pro:
              Social welfare [219] is seldom enough to keep people out of poverty.

            1.2.4.3.1.5.4. Pro:
            Poor minimum wage laws mean that parents often have to work multiple jobs, reducing the amount of time and care they can give their kids.

            1.2.4.3.1.5.5. Pro:
            Expensive healthcare [220] and increasing insurance premiums [221] prevent poor parents from nurturing their kids.

        1.2.4.3.2. Con:
        The doctrine of parens patriae [222] provides that the state has the right and legitimate authority to protect the interests and futures of persons who are legally unable to act on their own behalf, including children. This can allow the state to take custody of children.

        1.2.4.3.3. Con:
        A biological link to a child does not guarantee permanent custody of the child. This should be secondary to an individual's ability not to do undue harm to the child.

          1.2.4.3.3.1. Con:
          The institution of parent and child is older and more innate than that of the state. As such, without any other information, the parent should have custody of the child.

          1.2.4.3.3.2. Pro:
          Parents can lose custody of their children to the state, and their children may be permanently removed, if the parents are deemed unable to care for their children's safety and wellbeing.

            1.2.4.3.3.2.1. Pro:
            In Victoria, Australia, the court may make permanent care orders [223] if it is deemed to be in the child's best interests [224], such as their safety and wellbeing.

            1.2.4.3.3.2.2. Pro:
            The California Supreme Court has ruled that if children face substantial risk of harm, the state can take custody [225] of the children.

            1.2.4.3.3.2.3. Con:
            Parents have the ability to challenge rulings which take children into the custody of the state.

              1.2.4.3.3.2.3.1. Con:
              Given how child protective services try to avoid [226] presenting legal cases in the current system, it is likely that they will continue to avoid offering parents the opportunity to appeal.

              1.2.4.3.3.2.3.2. Pro:
              In the UK, the court must at least consider the wishes of a child's caregivers before making a care order [227], and care orders can be discharged if caregivers can prove that it was made in error or that circumstances have significantly changed [228] since it was issued.

              1.2.4.3.3.2.3.3. Pro:
              In the US, parents' rights in relation to a child being removed from their home includes the right to challenge any decision by the courts to to do so (p. 2 [229]).

            1.2.4.3.3.2.4. Pro:
            In Canada, if parents don't accept the gender identity [230] chosen by their children, the state can choose to take them away from their parents.

          1.2.4.3.3.3. Pro:
          In most US states, for example [231], rapists are denied parental rights for children conceived during the attack.

      1.2.4.4. Con:
      A license is only able to screen people beforehand, not act as an intervention agent after a person has a license. Rather than preventing abuse, it simply prevents able prospective parents from procreating.

        1.2.4.4.1. Con:
        A parenting license could require renewal, in the same way many other licenses do, which would ensure both a maintenance of standards and an opportunity for further education.

        1.2.4.4.2. Pro:
        It would be easy for an individual to 'tick boxes' to pass a parenting license assessment, and still go on to abuse their children at a later point.

      1.2.4.5. Pro:
      Under the status quo, abuse or neglect of infants or very young children often goes undetected.

        1.2.4.5.1. Pro:
        According to one study, up to 85% of child abuse goes undetected [232] in England.

        1.2.4.5.2. Con:
        It would be possible to introduce other early methods of detection of abuse for infants and young children. A licensing system is not needed to protect children.

          1.2.4.5.2.1. Pro:
          Some countries mandate health check-ins [233] with a public nurse at different stages of a child's development.

          1.2.4.5.2.2. Pro:
          Teachers [234] can be taught how to recognise signs of abuse.

          1.2.4.5.2.3. Con:
          Interventive action is currently often triggered only after some harm has already come to a child. A parenting license acts preemptively.

          1.2.4.5.2.4. Con:
          Most methods of detecting abuse rely on human perception, which is often flawed [235]. A licensing test would be based on expert analysis.

        1.2.4.5.3. Pro:
        For a variety of reasons, children often remain quiet about abuse.

          1.2.4.5.3.1. Pro:
          Children often feel guilty [236] that the abuse is taking place.

          1.2.4.5.3.2. Pro:
          Many children fear - or are told by their abuser - that they will not be believed [237] if they speak out.

          1.2.4.5.3.3. Pro:
          Children often fear the consequences [238] of speaking out, either for themselves, or for their abuser who is often someone close to them.

          1.2.4.5.3.4. Con:
          Children can be educated on abuse [239], which can encourage them to come forward about abuse that has happened or that has the potential to happen.

          1.2.4.5.3.5. Pro:
          Infants and young children are unable to verbalise [240] their experiences of abuse and neglect.

  1.3. Con:
  Parenting licenses violate parents' rights.

    1.3.1. Pro:
    Parenting licenses may come into conflict with many religious beliefs, which could constitute an attack on their freedom of thought, belief or religion [241].

      1.3.1.1. Pro:
      The Catholic Church [242] believes that artificial contraception is sinful and immoral since it interferes with a divine plan to bring a new life into the world. Catholics may oppose parenting licenses since contraception would likely play a huge part in pregnancy prevention before licenses are granted.

      1.3.1.2. Pro:
      Under some of the world's largest religions, procreation is seen as a God-given right and, for some, a duty.

        1.3.1.2.1. Con:
        State policy should prioritise what best benefits children and society at large over religious beliefs.

        1.3.1.2.2. Pro:
        In the Old Testament, the first command (for Christians) and the first mitzvah [243] (for Jews) given to people by God is to procreate; that they "be fruitful and multiply [244]".

        1.3.1.2.3. Pro:
        Procreation is considered a sacred right in Islam, and one of the faith's five basic goals (p. 54 [245]).

        1.3.1.2.4. Pro:
        In Hinduism, it is important to have a child, as it helps to fulfill one's obligations [246] to their ancestors.

      1.3.1.3. Con:
      There are a number of religious practices that have been outlawed, even though they have had a large following because they infringed on the rights of others.

        1.3.1.3.1. Pro:
        The UK is set to follow many other countries in banning LGBTQ+ conversion therapy [247], which is most often carried out on religious grounds: most notably by evangelical Christian groups.

        1.3.1.3.2. Pro:
        Sati [248] was a practice among some Hindu communities according to which a widow committed suicide or immolated herself on her husband's pyre. It was made illegal in British India in 1829 [249].

    1.3.2. Pro:
    The right to procreate is an essential liberty that falls under reproductive rights and is internationally recognized. Denying someone the right to procreate through the implementation of a parenting license runs contrary to this.

      1.3.2.1. Con:
      Some people are legally prohibited from raising a child, showing that the right is not absolute.

        1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.4.3.3.2.

        1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
        In the mid-1970s, India pursued an antinatalist policy that promoted the widespread forced sterilisation [250] of Indian citizens in mass camps.

        1.3.2.1.3. Con:
        It is only in certain extreme circumstances that the state can infringe on parental rights. A parenting license would likely have a lower bar than most of the current situations where this is allowed.

        1.3.2.1.4. Con:
        The right to raise a child is not the same as the right to procreate.

      1.3.2.2. Pro:
      International human rights law recognizes reproductive rights which underlie the right to procreate.

        1.3.2.2.1. Con:
        According to the European Convention of Human Rights, the right of children to have a family exists, while the right of adults wanting children to adopt does not (pp. 9, 13 [251]).

        1.3.2.2.2. Pro:
        Reproductive rights [252], according to World Health Organization, rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.

        1.3.2.2.3. Pro:
        The law of the United Nations recognizes such rights.

          1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro:
          Article 7.2 of the Cairo Programme of Action defines reproductive health and was adopted by 184 UN member states. It states that reproductive health also means that people have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so (p. 59 [253]).

          1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro:
          Both Article 16 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights [254] and Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [255] recognize that men and women have the right to marry and to found a family without any limitation.

            1.3.2.2.3.2.1. Pro:
            The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR [256]) is a legally binding treaty.

            1.3.2.2.3.2.2. Con:
            The Universal Declaration of Human Rights [257] is not legally binding.

          1.3.2.2.3.3. Con:
          Article 9 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child [258] enables the state to separate children from their parents if the children are being mistreated or neglected.

            1.3.2.2.3.3.1. Pro:
            Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child [259] requires the State to take all appropriate measures to protect children from "all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse".

            1.3.2.2.3.3.2. Pro:
            Article 20 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child [260] allows for a child to be temporarily or permanently removed from their parents if it is in the best interest of the child not to remain in the family environment.

              1.3.2.2.3.3.2.1. Pro:
              Article 20 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child [261] recognises that such children may be placed in "foster placement, kafalah of Islamic law, adoption or if necessary placement in suitable institutions for the care of children".

            1.3.2.2.3.3.3. Con:
            The Convention on the Rights of the Child [262] applies reactively to the protection of children. The text does not support imposing limitations on who may be parents prior to the birth of their children.

              1.3.2.2.3.3.3.1. Pro:
              The OHCHR defines [263] a child as a human below eighteen years of age, and makes no reference to future children.

          1.3.2.2.3.4. Pro:
          According to the UN, family is the basic institution of society [264], and not having the right to start one means not having the right to be included in society in the same conditions as others.

      1.3.2.3. Pro:
      The US Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution in favour of a right to procreate.

        1.3.2.3.1. Pro:
        In Skinner v. Oklahoma [265] (1942), the Court invalidated a state statute that provided for the mandatory sterilization of certain habitual criminals. Noting that the right to procreate was a basic right of man, the Court strictly limited the power of a state to impose involuntary sterilization.

        1.3.2.3.2. Pro:
        In Eisenstadt v. Baird [266] (1972), the Supreme Court expanded the scope of sexual privacy rights and recognized the right of single people to procreate on the same basis as married couples.

          1.3.2.3.2.1. Con:
          Imposing a license policy on everyone still maintains equal rights of procreation for single parents as well as couples. This policy will just mean a reduced right to have a child for everyone, but still an equal right.

        1.3.2.3.3. Con:
        US courts have not precluded the idea that limitations can be introduced on the right to procreate.

          1.3.2.3.3.1. Pro:
          State v. Oakley (2001), a Wisconsin Supreme Court case, introduced limitations on the right to procreate in the context of child support payments (pp. 447-448 [267]).

    1.3.3. Con:
    It would be fair towards people who (have to) adopt to make the procedure for procreation equally complex.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      Under the status quo, domestic adoption is such a difficult process that only about 10% [268] of prospective adoptive parents actually get to adopt.

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.2.2.2.1.

      1.3.3.3. Con:
      -> See 1.2.4.2.2.2.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    Parenting licenses assess parents' competency prospectively. This violates the right to the presumption of innocence [269].

      1.3.4.1. Con:
      The legal precedent of innocent before proven guilty is effective in the case of criminal justice, but not in the case of licensing systems.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      The state is not capable of reading the future, so creating policies that act as if they do is unfair.

        1.3.4.2.1. Con:
        While the state is incapable of reading the future, it can use statistics to assess risks and attempt to minimize them. That is why policies such as requiring a driver's license exist.

    1.3.5. Con:
    Rights are not absolute and in some cases end up competing against each other.

      1.3.5.1. Pro:
      Like the rights of any other citizen, parents' rights can be reconsidered by the state when the consequences of their actions and decisions affect other people or society.

        1.3.5.1.1. Con:
        The state should not interfere in the most personal decisions that an individual makes in the course of their lives.

          1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro:
          Some people strongly believe that having children is an essential part of the human experience. This policy ensures that some people, in their own eyes, aren't able to fulfill one of their purposes as a human being.

            1.3.5.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            More than 9 in 10 people [270] in the US have, want or wish they had children.

              1.3.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              -> See 1.1.3.4.3.

            1.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con:
            Framing procreation as a right to engage in a fulfilling life experience casts the child as an object to fulfill the desires of the parent.

              1.3.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              Objectifying children deprives them of their humanity as subjects and agents, whose life is worth preserving or protecting in and of itself.

              1.3.5.1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
              When parents are unable to recognize the child as a separate individual, they attempt to live through them and may become dependent on them. This can inflict serious emotional damage on the child (p. 51 [271]).

              1.3.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con:
              The feeling of fulfillment associated with having children (and the impulse to do so) has likely played a large role in the continuation of humanity as a species over the course of history.

          1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro:
          A licensing system may contravene privacy laws.

            1.3.5.1.1.2.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.2.5.2.1.

            1.3.5.1.1.2.2. Con:
            Competent adults are entitled to waive their privacy rights when they desire (p. 19 [272]). The desire of one to become a parent, and acquire a parenting license, would be a time when most would likely choose to waive such a right.

            1.3.5.1.1.2.3. Con:
            A licensing system could be designed in a privacy sensitive manner, in line with the key privacy principles [273].

            1.3.5.1.1.2.4. Pro:
            Any background checks, undertaken without permission, could violate a person's right to privacy.

        1.3.5.1.2. Pro:
        Poorly raised children can impact others in society, and so states should take a proactive role in safeguarding society as a whole.

          1.3.5.1.2.1. Pro:
          Children of those with poor parenting skills have a greater tendency towards delinquency (p. 765 [274]).

          1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro:
          Poor parenting is correlated with a tendency towards violence [275] in children.

      1.3.5.2. Pro:
      Where they clash, children's rights should overrule parents' rights.

        1.3.5.2.1. Pro:
        Parents' rights over their child are already limited. Parental autonomy is often overridden when it comes to questions of children's health and wellbeing.

          1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.4.3.3.2.

          1.3.5.2.1.2. Pro:
          Doctors can seek a court order to override the parents' wishes if it is in the child's best interests [276] to do so.

            1.3.5.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            In a life-threatening situation, doctors can give the children of Jehovah's Witnesses a blood transfusion [277], even if their parents refuse it on the grounds that their religion condemns it.

            1.3.5.2.1.2.2. Pro:
            Judges have concluded that parental authority is 'not unlimited [278]' in this context.

              1.3.5.2.1.2.2.1. Pro:
              In 2016 [279], a judge in Australia allowed a doctor to proceed with chemotherapy on a child's malignant brain tumor despite the principled objections of the parents.

          1.3.5.2.1.3. Con:
          The court tends only to impede on a parent's rights once a high bar [280] has been reached, such as when a parent has a history of child abuse, when the parent cannot communicate with the child, or when there are psychiatric concerns.

          1.3.5.2.1.4. Pro:
          Many countries have compulsory [281] school attendance laws that prohibit parents from taking children out of school.

        1.3.5.2.2. Pro:
        The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child [282] emphasizes the importance of prioritizing children's rights above all else.

        1.3.5.2.3. Con:
        -> See 1.2.2.1.1.

        1.3.5.2.4. Pro:
        The right to procreation is matched by the right [283] of a future child to be safe.

          1.3.5.2.4.1. Con:
          A child and and a parent are both humans with equivalent rights. Their rights should be weighed according to the type of right (quality of life vs. right to procreate), not their status as child or parent.

          1.3.5.2.4.2. Pro:
          The bodily autonomy of the parent comes at the expense of the bodily autonomy of the child. The purpose of the test is to limit the autonomy of the parents if it is deemed as harmful towards their unborn children.

          1.3.5.2.4.3. Pro:
          Focusing attention on the unilateral, autonomous and unlimited rights of prospective parents fails to account for the status of the child who will be produced and who has no say in their creation and future.

      1.3.5.3. Con:
      The potential harm to the child cannot be measured with absolute accuracy or any at all if a license is denied. However, the harm to the parents is clear and fully realized. Therefore we should preference their rights.

      1.3.5.4. Pro:
      Effective government action restricts some liberty in one area to allow greater liberty in another, as per John Stuart Mill's "Harm Principle [284]".

  1.4. Pro:
  A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    A parenting license would encourage responsible family planning.

      1.4.1.1. Pro:
      The license, and the associated process, would encourage parents to consider whether they truly want children, or whether they are simply succumbing to societal pressures [285].

      1.4.1.2. Pro:
      As those who wish to procreate will know how much their household must earn in order to be granted a license, they will aim for and save up accordingly.

        1.4.1.2.1. Con:
        In the US, African-Americans are less likely to be wealthy [286]. Imposing this license would likely lead to breaking up Black families and the institutionalization of even more Black children who are unlikely [287] to ever get adopted given social trends.

        1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
        There are various ways to offset [288] the costs of adoption, including local government subsidies, adoption tax credits (in the US), loans, and crowdfunding. Similar avenues could be explored to cover the expense of parental licenses.

          1.4.1.2.2.1. Con:
          Families on limited income are likely to suffer the repurcissions of, say, a loan than those who are more financially comfortable. This could act as a deterrent to poorer families and restrict their opportunity to raise a family.

            1.4.1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
            The cost of loans is typically higher for poor families than the general population (p. 24 [289]).

          1.4.1.2.2.2. Pro:
          In the UK, the state offers various forms of financial assistence [290] to help cover the costs of adoption.

        1.4.1.2.3. Pro:
        In the US, in order to adopt a child, you must have an income equal to or higher [291] than 125% of the US poverty level for your household size. The financial requirement to obtain a parental license would likely be based on a similar metric.

      1.4.1.3. Con:
      The lived experience of having children is likely to be sufficiently different to how you are taught such that children may still experience hardship [292], as is seen with adoption at present.

      1.4.1.4. Con:
      The administrative burdens [293] and stress of family licenses are likely to place undue stress on otherwise good parents. This is not a deterrent to bad parenting but rather parenting in general.

      1.4.1.5. Pro:
      Parents are often unaware of how difficult it is to raise a child. The process of acquiring a license will allow potential parents to better assess whether they are actually ready for children or not.

        1.4.1.5.1. Pro:
        All adoption agencies conduct interviews [294] and home-studies [295], which are meant to be educative experiences for prospective parents. When such interviews are conducted in the licensing process, parents will have an opportunity to learn more about parenting.

          1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro:
          The US (p. 3 [296]), the UK [297], and Australia [298] are some of the countries that provide either compulsory training or voluntary training services to prospective parents who wish to adopt in the status quo. Such training systems will therefore likely be incorporated into the licensing system.

          1.4.1.5.1.2. Con:
          People can learn [299] how to answer the questions involved in adoption interviews. The same will likely be true of a more general parenting test.

            1.4.1.5.1.2.1. Con:
            Even if parents are simply learning answers by rote [300], they are still developing foundational knowledge.

          1.4.1.5.1.3. Pro:
          Home-studies help to assess the emotional readiness [301] of a family.

          1.4.1.5.1.4. Pro:
          Interviews [302] in the adoption process help to ensure parents have the knowledge they need to raise a child, as well as their expectations of the child.

        1.4.1.5.2. Pro:
        Parenting education programs have been proven to work effectively in improving parenting, and could be easily integrated as part of a licensing system (p. 2 [303]).

          1.4.1.5.2.1. Pro:
          Most accredited adoption agencies, private and public, require [304] adoptive parents to take classes on parenting. These requirements, in the licensing system, will teach parents about the basics of parenting.

          1.4.1.5.2.2. Con:
          Parents can learn about parenting through dedicated classes, meet-ups or parenting books. It is not necessary to implement a licensing process to offer educative experiences for prospective parents.

            1.4.1.5.2.2.1. Con:
            Many parents do not do this, and are often ill-prepared to have children. This policy ensures that every parent will have basic knowledge on how to be a good parent.

            1.4.1.5.2.2.2. Pro:
            Parenting courses [305] can help improve communication between parent and child, help parents deal with their child's behavioral issues, and build a child's confidence.

            1.4.1.5.2.2.3. Pro:
            There are many online [306] parenting courses available to prospective parents.

        1.4.1.5.3. Con:
        Adults ought to be reasonably aware of the monetary and opportunity costs associated with raising a child, as this information is easily available.

          1.4.1.5.3.1. Pro:
          Health insurance companies [307] try to make it known to prospective parents how expensive it is to raise a child.

          1.4.1.5.3.2. Pro:
          The US government has publicized [308] the cost of raising a child in the US.

          1.4.1.5.3.3. Pro:
          There is significant evidence of parents, particularly mothers [309], reporting that their employment and career [310] options became increasingly limited after having a child.

          1.4.1.5.3.4. Con:
          Most parents vastly underestimate how much money it costs to raise a child.

            1.4.1.5.3.4.1. Pro:
            In one study [311] conducted in the US, half of would-be parents thought the first year of raising a child would cost $5,000 or less, whereas it costs just over $21,000 in a $40,000-income household.

            1.4.1.5.3.4.2. Pro:
            Excluding the cost of college, raising a child to the age of 18 in the US will cost approximately $233,610. Parents are often unaware [312] of the magnitude of such a cost, and are ill-prepared to have a child.

              1.4.1.5.3.4.2.1. Con:
              It is unclear how having a license will result in parents being able to meet the costs over the course of raising a child, since unexpected eventualities - such as illness or a period of unemployment or underemployment - may occur.

                1.4.1.5.3.4.2.1.1. Con:
                While there is no guarantee that parents who are granted a license based on their financial situation at the time will continue to be able to support a child in the future, licenses would ensure that prospective parents who, beyond reasonable doubt, cannot afford to raise a child are prevented from doing so in the first place.

        1.4.1.5.4. Pro:
        In recent years, children are increasingly ill-prepared to start school due to delayed essential communication skills and physical development [313], which may by symptomatic of parents being underequipped to engage with their children early on in their lives and to recognise when additional support is needed.

          1.4.1.5.4.1. Con:
          Children could be ill-prepared to start school for many reasons unrelated to parental neglect or abuse.

            1.4.1.5.4.1.1. Pro:
            Children may have learning disabilities [314] that cause them to fall behind in school.

            1.4.1.5.4.1.2. Con:
            The majority of reasons [315] for being ill-prepared for school - not getting enough sleep, not completing homework, not eating breakfast, not having the correct books - are controllable by parents.

          1.4.1.5.4.2. Con:
          There are structural reasons as to why some parents are unable to prepare their kids for school adequately.

            1.4.1.5.4.2.1. Pro:
            Some parents from low income communities have to work multiple jobs, work nonstandard hours, or work evenings and nights to support their children (p. 3 [316]). This could lead to children falling behind in school, as they do not have regular support structures at home.

              1.4.1.5.4.2.1.1. Pro:
              Parents often have to work multiple jobs because the state has failed to provide them with a decent standard of living through the guarantee of a minimum wage (p. 19 [317]). Therefore, poorer people should not be punished by the withholding of a parenting license.

              1.4.1.5.4.2.1.2. Con:
              If parents cannot make time for their children, then parenting licenses should still be used to preclude them from having children.

            1.4.1.5.4.2.2. Pro:
            Parents from immigrant communities might not be fluent in the language [318] spoken in that particular area. This makes the transfer of skill to the child virtually impossible.

            1.4.1.5.4.2.3. Con:
            While this may not be the fault of the parents themselves, the child's life will suffer from being born into such a family. Although this may be unfair to the prospective parents, it must be done to ensure a minimum standard of parenting for the future child.

          1.4.1.5.4.3. Pro:
          Many families do not have the financial resources [319] to support their children in their pre-school learning, which can lead to them being unprepared for starting school compared to their peers.

            1.4.1.5.4.3.1. Pro:
            In the US, children from poorer families are significantly less likely [320] to be ready to start school by the age of 5 than those from more financially stable homes.

        1.4.1.5.5. Con:
        The licensing process may not accurately reflect all the challenges of raising a child.

          1.4.1.5.5.1. Pro:
          Many individuals seem to be, and believe they are, ready to have children, but later come to realise that they regret [321] the decision.

    1.4.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.2.2.2.

    1.4.3. Con:
    Parenting licenses can only guarantee short term, superficial changes in a person's lifestyle or parenting choices. This is not enough to guarantee better parenting or to ensure meaningful long-term change in a child's well-being.

      1.4.3.1. Con:
      As long as parents love their children, they will want to improve as parents.

        1.4.3.1.1. Pro:
        Parents are driven by metrics such as their child's happiness [322] and success [323]. The maintenance of these metrics provides an incentive to keep providing the child with what they deem is best for them.

          1.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
          Parents [324] who are overly focused on their children's success can often be too controlling, which may stifle the child's ability to deal with obstacles in life or make independent choices as adults.

            1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.3.

          1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          The standards set by a parenting license would provide parents with clear, tangible, and achievable requirements for good parenting.

          1.4.3.1.1.3. Pro:
          A parenting license could help teach parents what to look out for in terms of assessing key metrics such as a child's happiness [325].

        1.4.3.1.2. Pro:
        Any parent who loves their child will try their hardest to ensure that their child lives a happy [326] and fulfilling life; it is unlikely that they will become complacent if they see their child suffering or struggling.

        1.4.3.1.3. Con:
        Not all parents [327] act with love toward their offspring.

        1.4.3.1.4. Con:
        If parents would improve their skills anyway, then there is no need to implement a licensing system in the first place.

      1.4.3.2. Con:
      Although there is no guarantee that everyone acquiring a parenting license will be a better parent than if they hadn't, the desire to acquire the license will encourage prospective parents to learn, therefore encouraging self-improvement in those who wish to procreate.

        1.4.3.2.1. Pro:
        As everyone who wanted to be a parent would need to meet the standards of being a good parent as determined by the state, these standards would become established as normative standards as well.

        1.4.3.2.2. Pro:
        At the very least, focusing attention on a licensing system is likely to increase the belief that parenting is a skill and not an inherent ability. It is difficult to argue that increasing the amount of conversation and shared ideas would be detrimental to parenting.

      1.4.3.3. Con:
      This presumes ill-intent on the part of all parents that are not good parents. "Bad" parents may not be so deliberately, but may simply lack the knowledge to be a competent parent. The process of licensing could give them parenting tools that would have been otherwise unavailable.

      1.4.3.4. Pro:
      There is evidence from examining occupational licensing that increased licensing does not necessarily lead to higher quality.

        1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
        A study found that occupational licensing of dentists did not lead to improved measured dental outcomes of patients (p. 176 [328]).

  1.5. Con:
  Parenting licenses will bring undue harm to people.

    1.5.1. Con:
    The emotional harm faced by parents is outweighed by the fact that the test is likely to preserve and protect the rights of children born to unfit parents.

      1.5.1.1. Con:
      Parents' stress levels can affect [329] a child’s risk of mood disorders, addiction, and even neurological disorders such as ADHD and autism. Making parents constantly think about their child being taken away from them is likely to negatively affect the child.

        1.5.1.1.1. Pro:
        If a person has unexpectedly become pregnant, they will need to acquire the license while experiencing a difficult pregnancy. The need to acquire a license during an unplanned pregnancy could lead to additional stress, which could lead to a low-birthweight baby [330].

        1.5.1.1.2. Pro:
        It is not clear whether such a policy would be required just once, of for each subesequent child in a family. In the case where parents are worried about being granted a license for an additional child, their elevated stress levels are likely to also have an effect on any children they already have.

      1.5.1.2. Pro:
      Currently, many children die of abuse while their case is being investigated [331] by child protection services. A licensing system can ensure that children are not brought into abusive homes in the first place.

      1.5.1.3. Con:
      Due to the administrative processes and systems around them, current child protection services are often inadequate and can lead to trauma for the children and parents involved.

        1.5.1.3.1. Pro:
        In the UK, MPs have warned [332] that child protection services are inadequate, and are 'too slow' to improve, calling out government ministers for complacency in the matter.

        1.5.1.3.2. Pro:
        In many parts of the US, factors such as confidentiality laws - which hamper adequate sharing of data on abuse fatalities - and understaffing allow child protection services to operate with impunity [333].

          1.5.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          Even where child protection services are aware of at-risk children in the US, authorities can be slow to hire staff to work the cases, despite there being a backlog [334] of open abuse and neglect investigations.

        1.5.1.3.3. Pro:
        In order to cope with the unresolved grief [335] of having a child taken away, many end up relying [336] on alcohol and drugs to ease the pain.

        1.5.1.3.4. Con:
        Administrative processes can easily be amended through the introduction of different regulations and processes.

          1.5.1.3.4.1. Pro:
          More social workers could be hired to combat backlogs. This could be done by hiring recent graduates [337].

          1.5.1.3.4.2. Pro:
          Any laws which make adoption more difficult can be removed through the legislative process.

          1.5.1.3.4.3. Con:
          Amending administrative processes may be difficult, as they could cost the state time and money.

          1.5.1.3.4.4. Con:
          There is no will to amend the administrative processes around child protective services, as the main benefit would be to largely disenfranchised [338] parents and children, who have little political capital [339].

      1.5.1.4. Pro:
      The primary responsibility of the state should be towards seeking to do what is best for the child, as it is vulnerable and requires protection from potentially bad parents.

        1.5.1.4.1. Con:
        Children whose parents are deemed unfit will end up in the foster care system, which is problematic in most countries.

          1.5.1.4.1.1. Con:
          The foster care system would improve in a world where parenting licenses were required.

            1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            With greater emphasis put on the foster care system, programs like CHAMPS [340], which aim to spur policy reforms to prioritise quality foster parenting and ensure that foster parents are better trained and supported, become more likely to be implemented.

            1.5.1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
            Foster parents and foster care home staff would likely be required to have a parenting license.

            1.5.1.4.1.1.3. Con:
            The foster care system throughout the USA is already overcrowded, with over 400,000 children [341] in the system on any given day. It would be difficult to improve such a system in a world where more children come into the system.

            1.5.1.4.1.1.4. Con:
            The privatization [342] of foster care could be implemented to try and improve the system, but it would ultimately lead to negative outcomes.

              1.5.1.4.1.1.4.1. Con:
              Private investment in the foster care system could help fund training and payment [343] for prospective foster parents.

          1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro:
          The foster care system in most countries is subject to exploitation and inefficiencies.

            1.5.1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
            Due to a lack of adequate mental health service provision in the system, young children in foster care can often be over-prescribed psychotropic drugs [344] to modify their behavior, rather than equiping them with strategies to cope with any past trauma.

              1.5.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro:
              A study conducted on children from 2 to 14 in the US foster care system showed that nearly 50% [345] have significant clinical mental health problems.

            1.5.1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
            The turnover of case workers [346] in the US is over 20% due to burn out, with many states allocating them three or four times the recommended case number. This undermines the efficiency of the system.

              1.5.1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro:
              -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.

            1.5.1.4.1.2.3. Pro:
            Some US foster care agencies and their contractors were found to be targeting disabled children or those whose parents have died in order to exploit [347] their access to federal disability and survivor benefits, then subsequently applying for control over the child’s assets.

            1.5.1.4.1.2.4. Con:
            Non-profit organizations [348] help to account for the inefficiencies in the foster care system.

            1.5.1.4.1.2.5. Con:
            Canada is reforming [349] its indigenous foster care system.

              1.5.1.4.1.2.5.1. Con:
              This reform of the indigenous foster care system is only happening in the wake of revelations about how poorly [350] the Canadian government has treated indigenous children in the past.

          1.5.1.4.1.3. Pro:
          The instability and subsequent negative effects born out of time spent in foster care are long-lasting and can shape the course of a person's life.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
            Swedish [351] men who were placed in foster care as children were shown to be 23% more likely to be convicted of a crime as adults than their peers.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
            Foster children move multiple houses when they are in the system, sometimes moving house eight or more times [352].

              1.5.1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro:
              Children in foster care move schools at least once or twice a year [353], losing out on four to six months of academic progress each time they move. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood that they will graduate.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.2.2. Con:
              Foster children can be moved between homes respectfully, which would diminish the harms the children would otherwise experience (p. 2 [354]).

              1.5.1.4.1.3.2.3. Con:
              Moving foster children between homes is preferable to leaving them in unsafe environments.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.2.4. Pro:
              Children who move foster homes frequently lack stability [355] in their lives and may struggle to form relationships or bonds with anyone for a significant period of time.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.3. Pro:
            Children who are fostered are at higher risk [356] of becoming incarcerated, homeless, or pregnant later in life than other children, whilst also being less likely to have a job or go to college. This is often put down to state, financial, and emotional support abruptly ceasing once they reach the age of 18.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.4. Con:
            There are fewer negative effects from foster care when children are placed in kinship care with extended family members.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.4.1. Pro:
              There is evidence that children in kinship care see greater outcomes than children faced in regular foster care in terms of identity formation, stability, and in gaining support through mental health challenges (p. 2 [357]).

              1.5.1.4.1.3.4.2. Con:
              In Ireland, only 26% of foster children are in kinship [358], or relative, foster care.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.5. Con:
            Children who have been through the foster care system often come out as more resilient individuals.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.5.1. Pro:
              There are many examples of programs which successfully help foster children to become resilient (p. 1171 [359]).

              1.5.1.4.1.3.5.2. Pro:
              Some people who were fostered as children believe the experience made them stronger [360].

              1.5.1.4.1.3.5.3. Con:
              This effect could easily be in spite of having being in foster care, rather than because of it.

            1.5.1.4.1.3.6. Pro:
            The foster care system is not a safe or positive environment for children to be in.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.6.1. Pro:
              -> See 1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.6.2. Con:
              While the foster care system may not be perfect, it is a place of safety necessary for many children who need to be removed from dangerous situations.

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.2.1. Pro:
                40 percent [361] of foster care placements occur because the parents were substance abusers. Such parents never provided a healthy environment for their children to begin with.

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.2.2. Pro:
                A significant portion of the children who end up in foster care are confirmed victims of abuse (p. 15 [362]). They have already suffered the trauma before reaching the foster care system.

              1.5.1.4.1.3.6.3. Pro:
              Abuse and neglect are endemic in many countries' foster care [363] and group homes [364].

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.3.1. Pro:
                Between 2009 and 2012 in the UK [365], there were between 450-550 proven cases of abuse each year for children spending time in foster care.

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.3.2. Pro:
                Despite $22 billion being spent on foster care programs [366] every year in the US, nearly 60,000 children are reported weekly as abused or neglected. This suggests that the state is incapable of effectively preventing child abuse within the foster care system.

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.3.3. Pro:
                Children in group homes [367] are more than 10 times as likely to be physically abused, and more than 28 times as likely to be sexually abused, than children in the general population. Both of these factors contribute [368] to conflicts with authority later in life.

                1.5.1.4.1.3.6.3.4. Con:
                The majority [369] of children in foster homes do not experience abuse, neglect or other maltreatment.

          1.5.1.4.1.4. Con:
          -> See 1.1.2.2.2.1.2.

        1.5.1.4.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.5.2.2.

        1.5.1.4.3. Con:
        The state often acts prematurely or unjustly in taking children away from their parents, which could lead to more harm for both parent and child.

          1.5.1.4.3.1. Pro:
          If this happens when the child is young, such a separation is occuring in the most important stages [370] in the baby's development.

          1.5.1.4.3.2. Pro:
          In 2014 [371], a South Carolina woman was arrested and her child was taken away by the state for letting her 9-year-old play alone in a park.

          1.5.1.4.3.3. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.4.5.

          1.5.1.4.3.4. Con:
          The state is justified in acting quickly if a young and vulnerable child is potentially at risk and needs to be removed from their family, since it is best to do so when they are an infant.

            1.5.1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
            Separation anxiety [372] typically hits babies after 8 months, after which it becomes hard for them to remain separate from their parents. It is best to take them away when they are newborns, to prevent a relationship from forming which can lead to separation anxiety.

            1.5.1.4.3.4.2. Pro:
            Trauma in a child's early years can be the cause of lifelong [373] complications for an individual: removing a child at an early age goes some way to mitigating this risk.

            1.5.1.4.3.4.3. Con:
            When a child is removed when they are older, the circumstances of their removal from their parents can be explained to them and so it may be easier for them to understand.

            1.5.1.4.3.4.4. Con:
            Taking a child away from its mother at a young age could deprive it of its opportunity to breastfeed.

              1.5.1.4.3.4.4.1. Pro:
              Children have a right to breastfeed (p. 1 [374]).

              1.5.1.4.3.4.4.2. Pro:
              Breastfeeding is important for the health [375] of a developing child.

              1.5.1.4.3.4.4.3. Con:
              Breastfeeding should be balanced [376] against the other emotional and physical needs of a child.

                1.5.1.4.3.4.4.3.1. Pro:
                A child's need to be breastfed is outweighed by their need for a secure, safe, and strong bond with an attachment figure, which may be lacking in circumstances where a child is removed from their birth parents. Such a bond can be achieved as successfully [377] through bottle feeding by a caregiver.

              1.5.1.4.3.4.4.4. Con:
              It is possible to induce lactation [378] in adoptive and foster mothers.

            1.5.1.4.3.4.5. Pro:
            90% [379] of a child's brain development occurs in the first five years of their life. It is therefore critical that they are properly cared for in this time.

        1.5.1.4.4. Pro:
        Providing special protection to those who are weak, have difficulties defending themselves, and are vulnerable [380] to violations of their fundamental human rights is a responsibility of the state.

    1.5.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.3.3.2.1.

    1.5.3. Pro:
    A parenting license system would adversely affect some groups in society more than others.

      1.5.3.1. Pro:
      Such a law could be abused as it inherently targets the bodies of people who have the ability to birth children. As such, it significantly affects women more than men.

        1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.4.3.1.4.1.1.

        1.5.3.1.2. Pro:
        Society already considers societal surveillance of female bodies legitimate when it comes to sexuality and pregnancy [381]. The introduction of parental licenses would exacerbate [382] this.

        1.5.3.1.3. Con:
        If raising children requires social resources beyond that which the mother can provide on her own, then it is fair to demand basic maternal competence in return for access to those resources.

        1.5.3.1.4. Pro:
        In countries where they have been used, policies restricting birth have had a severe impact on the female population in particular.

          1.5.3.1.4.1. Pro:
          In Uzbekistan [383], women are increasingly sterilised after their second child without knowledge or consent, in order to curb population growth.

          1.5.3.1.4.2. Pro:
          In China, where a form of parenting license existed in the one-child policy, suicide rates [384] were higher for women than for men - the only country in the world where this was the case.

          1.5.3.1.4.3. Con:
          Countries where policies like this have been tried in the past have been authoritarian [385], and so do not serve as good examples of how a licensing policy would play out in most of the world.

        1.5.3.1.5. Con:
        Men would also be affected significantly, as they too would lose the opportunity to parent.

          1.5.3.1.5.1. Con:
          Women tend to form attachments with their child when they are still in the womb [386]. Men, on the other hand, tend to form attachments after spending time [387] with their baby. If a child is taken from the parent immediately after birth on account of not having a license, then the woman's lost opportunity to parent is more significant.

          1.5.3.1.5.2. Pro:
          Where both people lose the chance to become parents, there is no unequal treatment.

      1.5.3.2. Con:
      All policies adversely affect one group over another. Otherwise there would be no point to having the policy at all.

      1.5.3.3. Pro:
      Both the licensing body as an organisation and its individual members are likely to exhibit biases when issuing licenses.

        1.5.3.3.1. Pro:
        There are multiple reports [388] of individual social workers exhibiting bias towards certain families. It is likely this would be transferred to a licensing policy with a similar assessment process.

        1.5.3.3.2. Con:
        Having the input of experts into the licensing tests can help ensure that the tests are fair and unbiased.

          1.5.3.3.2.1. Con:
          Experts [389] themselves can also be biased.

          1.5.3.3.2.2. Pro:
          Experts have a deeper understanding [390] of a subject than most ordinary individuals. The same is true of parenting.

          1.5.3.3.2.3. Con:
          Experts still disagree on how best to parent children, such as how much technology [391] is optimal.

        1.5.3.3.3. Con:
        The opinions, and therefore biases, of multiple people will cancel out one another, resulting in a balanced test.

        1.5.3.3.4. Pro:
        The existence of established prejudices means that licenses have the potential to discriminate against people from poorer economic backgrounds, rather than support them.

          1.5.3.3.4.1. Pro:
          Current policies on adoption already discriminate against poor people.

            1.5.3.3.4.1.1. Con:
            -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.3.2.

            1.5.3.3.4.1.2. Pro:
            Children in the more deprived areas of the UK are 10 times [392] more likely to end up in foster care, compared to the rest of the country.

            1.5.3.3.4.1.3. Pro:
            -> See 1.4.1.2.1.

            1.5.3.3.4.1.4. Con:
            Failing to provide their basic necessities of life can result in severe negative impacts [393] on a child. Instituting a minimum income threshold results in fewer children suffering.

            1.5.3.3.4.1.5. Pro:
            -> See 1.4.1.2.3.

          1.5.3.3.4.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.4.3.1.1.

          1.5.3.3.4.3. Con:
          Licensing could benefit people from poorer backgrounds if the license allows qualified, but poor, parents greater access to benefits.

            1.5.3.3.4.3.1. Pro:
            Offering a tax credit incentive to parents to take such a course/license could be a better solution.

          1.5.3.3.4.4. Pro:
          It is very likely that corruption would affect this license. Those with money would bribe officials to obtain licenses.

          1.5.3.3.4.5. Con:
          Researchers have found that there is no clear-cut causal link between poverty and parenting (p. 2 [394]). As such, there is no reason why a test for parenting would have to stipulate that the prospective parent must fall within a specific economic bracket.

          1.5.3.3.4.6. Con:
          In instances where individuals are not able to provide for their family, they rely on welfare from the state. There is no reason why they could not do the same, even if licenses were created.

        1.5.3.3.5. Pro:
        History shows that allowing an institution to dictate the standards by which parenting is judged opens up the possibility for such laws to be used to discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity.

          1.5.3.3.5.1. Pro:
          There is a high correlation [395] between race and domestic violence. A racist regime could use correlations to create the illusion of causation and justify racial exclusions on that basis.

          1.5.3.3.5.2. Pro:
          This is likely to lead to the homogenisation of society, as only those that fit a specific profile will be able to reproduce.

            1.5.3.3.5.2.1. Pro:
            Studies [396] show that diversity, rather than homogeneity, is optimal for driving innovation [397]. As such, societal homogenisation is not desirable.

            1.5.3.3.5.2.2. Pro:
            A homogeneous gene pool is more vulnerable [398] to potential super bugs or other environmental pressures. By creating homogeneity we endanger the entire species.

          1.5.3.3.5.3. Pro:
          In places such as the UK and US, institutions that would be involved in determining standards of good parenting, such as medical institutions [399], psychological professionals [400] and the civil service [401], are notoriously white-dominated. As such, parental licenses would grant additional power to society at large to control and regulate the behaviour of ethnic minorities.

          1.5.3.3.5.4. Con:
          The prohibition of parenting for groups who engage in regressive practices is legitimate.

            1.5.3.3.5.4.1. Pro:
            If a culture dictates things such as female genital mutilation [402], a country has a right to ban such practices.

            1.5.3.3.5.4.2. Con:
            A country can ban regressive practices without instituting a parenting licensing system.

          1.5.3.3.5.5. Pro:
          There are many historical examples of discrimination on the part of institutions empowered to make decisions about parenting.

            1.5.3.3.5.5.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.6.3.

            1.5.3.3.5.5.2. Con:
            Social media means governments are now more accountable [403] than ever, which shows that repeats of the issues of the past are not a certainty.

            1.5.3.3.5.5.3. Pro:
            In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, indigenous Native Americans were dubbed unfit to parent (p. 4 [404]), and the government was able to remove their children and place them in white run boarding schools [405].

          1.5.3.3.5.6. Con:
          Humanity can learn [406] from history's past flaws without necessarily being bound by them.

      1.5.3.4. Pro:
      Those who do not fit the accepted norm of a family unit could be prejudiced by this system.

        1.5.3.4.1. Pro:
        Licensing could discriminate against same-sex couples.

          1.5.3.4.1.1. Con:
          There is no legislation forbidding same sex-couples from adopting [407] in the US. There is no reason why there should be for a parental license, either.

            1.5.3.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            Children growing up with same-sex parents are at no disadvantage [408] compared to those with heterosexual parents. The licensing body would thus have no objective justification for discriminating against same-sex couples.

            1.5.3.4.1.1.2. Con:
            In 2017, Texas [409] passed a bill that allowed state-funded adoption agencies to deny adoption [410] to those belonging to certain groups - including LGBTQ+ couples - based on their own religious views.

            1.5.3.4.1.1.3. Con:
            Countries other than the US do ban or restrict gay adoption [411].

              1.5.3.4.1.1.3.1. Pro:
              In Israel [412], LGBTQ+ couples applying to adopt are explicitly discriminated against. Such discrimination could be replicated under the parenting licensing model.

          1.5.3.4.1.2. Pro:
          The Catholic Church [413] has long opposed same-sex parenthood. In countries where the religion has a significant standing, it is likely that the license's conditions would be prejudiced against same-sex couples.

        1.5.3.4.2. Con:
        Current proposed ammendments to US law would extended [414] anti-discrimination laws to protect prospective adoptive and foster parents who risk prejudice in this way. The same could be done in the case of parental licenses.

        1.5.3.4.3. Pro:
        Licensing could discriminate against single parents.

          1.5.3.4.3.1. Con:
          Children of single parents are at a disadvantage [415]; therefore creating a policy resulting in fewer single people becoming parents would be justified.

            1.5.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
            While the children of single parents may be more at-risk, that does not mean they cannot overcome the challenges associated with it and grow and thrive.

          1.5.3.4.3.2. Con:
          Many countries allow single parents to adopt.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.1. Pro:
            In the US, a prospective parent's marital status or relationship status does not affect [416] their eligibility to adopt.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.2. Pro:
            There are no adoption restrictions based on the prospective parent's partner status [417] in the UK.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.3. Pro:
            Application for adoptions in Australia [418] do not require the prospective parent to be in a relationship.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.4. Con:
            In Germany, single parents can only adopt under 'exceptional cases [419]'.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.5. Con:
            While it is not prohibited, adoption agencies and birth parents often exhibit a bias [420] towards two-parent homes, leaving single parents at the bottom of the waiting list.

              1.5.3.4.3.2.5.1. Pro:
              In Canada, single parents are 50% less likely [421] to be placed with a child.

          1.5.3.4.3.3. Pro:
          A financial requirement would disproportionately affect single parents as they earn less than married couples.

            1.5.3.4.3.3.1. Pro:
            In South Korea [422], single-parent households earn less than half the national average.

            1.5.3.4.3.3.2. Pro:
            A significant portion of single mothers in the US live in poverty [423].

            1.5.3.4.3.3.3. Con:
            Welfare states provide assistance to single parents. This would still exist in a world where parenting licenses exist, allowing single parents to raise children.

              1.5.3.4.3.3.3.1. Pro:
              Australia [424] has a welfare programme which offers payments to single parents.

            1.5.3.4.3.3.4. Pro:
            Single parent families across the developed world are significantly more likely to live in poverty [425] than families with two parents.

              1.5.3.4.3.3.4.1. Pro:
              In 2015, in the US, traditional two-parent families earned an income that was more than three times higher [426] than for households headed by a single mother.

        1.5.3.4.4. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.3.2.

      1.5.3.5. Con:
      Requirements that would become culturally invasive or discriminatory [427] would be open to widespread criticism [428] and backlash, much like discriminatory laws have faced in the past. This makes it less likely that the government would pursue such policies.

        1.5.3.5.1. Con:
        Widespread backlash may not arise if the minority group is not liked [429] by society at large.

        1.5.3.5.2. Pro:
        Attempting to use standardised parenting tests to eradicate a group of people would be quickly noticed, in the case that few members of a minority group acquire licenses.

        1.5.3.5.3. Con:
        Many countries are already committing atrocities [430] against minority groups, with little international accountability.

"Government bureaucracies are generally assumed to be less efficient than the private sector for the provision of goods and services. This is a sweeping generalization, but its widespread support suggests that there is more than a kernel of truth behind it.
...
The superior performance of private organizations is generally attributed to the profit motive that spur them to uses resources more efficiently and the virtue of competition which forces organizations to outdo each other, or perish."

"ICTs offer immense possibilities for the reduction of administrative burdens as it improves information management, dissemination and transactions. First, the capacity to deal with enormous amounts of data can improve government responsiveness to external demands. Second, the reach of information dissemination is multiplied exponentially with the use of electronic means, especially using Internet-based and e-mail networks. And third, the electronic exchange of data instead of the traditional paperwork transactions is a powerful tool to reduce administrative burdens. Finally, time and space limits can be effectively eliminated through “24 hours 7 days a week” access to services through access to a computer."

People with dissociative identity disorder tend to have personal histories of recurring, overpowering, severe and often life-threatening traumas such as physical or sexual abuse before the age of nine; which is thought to be a key developmental age. The cause of dissociative identity disorder may also be extreme neglect or emotional abuse even if no overt physical or sexual abuse occurred. DID may also be related to a natural disaster, such as war. According to WebMD, findings indicate that parents who are frightening and unpredictable tend to raise children who experience dissociation."

"The economic criticism of the welfare state ultimately focuses on its negative impact on the long-run economic growth. The intermediate variables are the tax burden, reduced private savings, reduced employment, and chronic fiscal fragility or outright fiscal crises.

The moral criticism shows how the repeated deviant behavior (using or misusing various social benefits) erodes social norms such as honesty, a strong work ethic, and family values (Lindbeck, Nyberg, and Weibull 1999; Niskanen 1996).1 Moral criticism also highlights how some social benefits undermine the family and lead to increased criminality, especially among young men brought up without fathers.

Philosophical and political criticism refers to the erosion of social norms that are especially important for conservative critics of the welfare state. The “liberal” (libertarian) critics focus on two related problems."

"In summary, if you want to become a doctor in the US, you must first complete a four-year undergraduate program, then attend medical school for four years and after graduating, spend somewhere between three to seven years as a resident, depending on the specialty of your choice. After all this, you need to take a licensing exam for the state where you want to practice medicine. That is between 10 and 14 years to become a licensed doctor. Now, let me break it down for you."

Force is not involved in prenatal screening decision making (except in presumably rare but understudied familial circumstances) but, arguably, eugenics does not require force. One can claim that even making screening available for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions is already, by definition, suggesting that they are not valued reproductive outcomes"

As an adult, Lautrec had a normally proportioned upper body but the stubby legs of a dwarf; his mature height was barely five feet, and he walked with great difficulty using a cane. Lautrec compensated for his physical deformities with alcohol and an acerbic, self-deprecating wit. His sympathetic fascination with the marginal in society, as well as his keen caricaturist’s eye, may be partly explained by his own physical handicap."

"Unfortunately, in the past, there were cases of abuse or neglect of adopted children. The home study is designed to ensure you can provide a safe home for a child. They do not want to scrutinize every nook and cranny of your home, they want to get to know you, have an idea of how you will be like as a parent, and conduct background checks necessary to make sure any child you bring home will be safe.

While it can feel invasive and be time-consuming, the odds of someone failing a home study are very slim. The possible scenarios for you to not be approved is if you have a criminal conviction for child abuse or another serious crime; or if you have a home that is not suitable for children—not because of dust bunnies but because there is no running water or electricity. Also due to dangerous areas of your home such as an unsecured pool or unsecured weapons."

All departments can provide both medical and surgical abortion but most abortions are done medically in Norway, 78%. Most departments also provide home treatment with misoprostol up to 9 weeks (90%) and about 85% medical abortion also between 9-12 weeks. All abortions after 12 weeks are done medically. All women have access to an abortion completely free of charge. If they are EU citizens or have an insurance the hospitals in Norway will claim the cost back from the insurance companies and the E111 form, but they are not allowed to charge women for an abortion."

"But CPS systems have improvised clever tactics to avoid ever presenting a legal case to a judge when they remove a child. There is a long history in many states of using so-called voluntary placement agreements that explicitly aim to avoid the requirement of court orders. In more than thirty states, policies and practices authorize even more informal separations, which are agreements in name only. Innocuously called “safety plans,” these devices are utilized to circumvent the duty to afford due process to the families from whom children are taken. Safety plans are usually oral directives, issued to parents following a CPS Hotline call, that require parents to give their children over to relatives under threat of forced removal and placement with strangers."

"The uncomfortable truth is that most of us don’t come across the way we intend. We can’t see ourselves truly objectively, and neither can anyone else. Human beings have a strong tendency to distort other people’s feedback to fit their own views. We know this intellectually, and yet we rarely seem to recognize it as it’s happening."

"For instance, a child who is neglected at home may be given much wanted attention by the abuser and this makes the child keen to spend more time with them. Later, this makes it difficult for the child to tell anyone about the abuse because the child believes they have encouraged the abuse by seeking our attention. This is part of the abusers plan."
[237] https://www.barnardos.org.uk/how-child-abusers-operate
"The abuser will then use a range of tactics to try and silence the child or ensure that if the child tells, they’re not believed - or even heard."
[238] https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/disclosure-child-abuse/
"Children often hold back from telling someone about the abuse they’re suffering because they’re scared of what might happen next. They may worry that they’ll get in trouble (with the person they’ve told or with the abuser) or that they’ll get the abuser in trouble for ‘telling on them’. The child may also be concerned about the adult’s reaction – that they’ll be angry, frightened or shocked, that they may go to the police or that they’ll have the child put into care."

"Younger children, or those who have a disability, may not have the words to describe what is happening to them, let alone the ability to understand what is going on. Children are vulnerable at any age but particularly so if they don’t have the skills to recognise the abuse. This can easily lead to cases of abuse going undetected."

The institution of marriage is considered sacred even by those who view it as a civil contract."

It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must inevitably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else. But this right of parents to free choice will remain illusory unless they are aware of the alternatives open to them. Hence, the right of every family to information and the availability of services in the field is increasingly considered as a basic human right and as an indispensable ingredient of human dignity.'"

Moreover, this meta-analysis revealed that negative aspects of support including rejection, hostility and neglect and psychological control had the strongest links to delinquency. Furthermore, several indicators of parental monitoring, including parental knowledge, child disclosure, and active monitoring by parents, had similar links to delinquency."

responses; instead, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the "Personal Responsibility and Work Act" of 1996, emphasizing human capital improvement for poor single mothers with the singular goal of reducing the number of recipients on AFDC, not the number in poverty. Welfare "reform" in this case also failed to address the structural problem of low wages, and allowed the government to abdicate any responsibility for intervening in the labor market."

A lack of ability and/or confidence in speaking and writing English can mean that there is less engagement; this includes not having the confidence to join discussions and groups in the school environment, not being able to engage in parents’ evenings and not being able to help with homework and understanding the course material. This lack of involvement has the potential to create a barrier between the mother and her child, and in turn this may have a detrimental effect on the child’s development and wellbeing."

"To fill this gap in services Tusla uses private fostering providers. These private companies recruit and support their own foster carers and charge Tusla to place children in care in one of the agency’s families.

There has been slow but consistent growth in private foster care placements and an increase in the number of companies in this market. While these companies plug a gap in services, a gap that can leave children at risk, ultimately they lead to negative outcomes across the system. 

This is not a reflection on the excellent work done by foster families with private services, but a consequence of systemic issues."

"Average people with good intentions don’t have the skills to cope with the high needs of many kids in the system today, Wilson says.

Wilson is calling for 1,000 parents in the state, or about one-fifth of the available homes, to be specially trained and paid extra, on top of the usual reimbursements to cover children’s basic needs. There would be higher expectations for these “professional” caregivers, and they’d be equipped and supported to take on the “pretty severe problems” that many of the kids have, he says.
...

Wilson suggests a figure of $1,000 a month per foster family, to compensate them for their experience, knowledge and skills. That would cost less – perhaps substantially less – than $12 million a year, a mere 1 percent of the Children’s Administration budget. And it would also reduce the need for residential facilities, which can cost the state upwards of $10,000 a month per child."

"Around 8 months, however, your infant begins to distinguish between people, and he forms strong emotional attachments to his caregivers. He's also learning the concept of object permanence: things and people (including Mom and Dad) still exist even when she can't see them anymore.

"Thus, children should be viewed as having the right to be breastfed, not in the sense that the mother is obligated to breastfeed the child, but in the sense that no one may interfere with the mother's right to breastfeed the child. Breastfeeding should be viewed as the right of the mother and child together."

[376] https://breastfeeding.support/custody-and-breastfeeding/
"However, focusing just on a child’s reliance on breastfeeding is not taking into account the bigger picture of healthy attachment. It is very desirable for a baby to have a primary attachment figure as this affects a child’s emotional health throughout their life.

"As Cramer notes, “Reproducing women are increasingly subject to surveillance and regulation by the state, strangers and each other. Barely any aspect of reproductive decision-making has been left untouched—from an employer’s interest in a woman’s use of birth control, to the state’s interest in her miscarriage.” This regulation is carried out by the state, of course, and seeps into everyday life through the judgmental looks from strangers and comments pregnant women receive."

"Bonding also helps parents feel connected to their newest family member. It begins to happen even before the baby is born -- when you feel the first little flutters in your belly or see your baby kick on the ultrasound screen. Your baby also starts getting to know you in the womb through the sound of your voice."
[387] https://www.nct.org.uk/life-parent/bonding-and-caring-for-your-baby/how-can-dads-bond-their-baby
"Pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding can give mums a bit of a head start in bonding. But dads can, and do, develop the most intense and powerful bonds with their children. It might just take a little longer than it does with mum.

Dads develop their bond with their baby by communicating, caring and playing. As your baby develops with smiles, laughter and babbling, a true two-way relationship starts to develop. It can take on average six months to reach this point but it will happen.

The bond most dads have with their six-month-old baby is fundamentally different to the one they had immediately after birth."

"Without genetic variation, a population cannot evolve in response to changing environmental variables and, as a result, may face an increased risk of extinction. For example, if a population is exposed to a new disease, selection will act on genes for resistance to the disease if they exist in the population. But if they do not exist — if the right genetic variation is not present — the population will not evolve and could be wiped out by the disease."

"The Browning Ruling stated that Native American parents, technically children themselves and intellectually inferior, had no right or say as to when, where, and whether or not their children would go to school. “And if Indians are reduced to children, then their parental role is debased, and their children will be raised by some agency of the parent-state.”

The Browning 
Ruling allowed the government to move children wherever they chose, most often to school on the other 
side of the country from their parents to decrease runaways and to keep children from learning
